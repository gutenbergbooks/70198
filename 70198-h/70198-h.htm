  <h2 class='c011'>THE TESTIMONY OF MRS. MARY CHEEVERS REGARDING THEM TWO.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c015'><i>By CLO GRAVES.</i></h3>
<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Never</span> having had much book-learning in my
time, having entered into that state of life
into which it pleased them above to call me,
more than fifty years before the piano began
to be taught in Board-schools, with part singing
on the cistern of the tonic sofas, as to
hear Cheevers’s sister Eliza’s daughter Grace’s
eldest Emmeline sing “Come buy my Coloured
’Errin’,” and recite “Not a Drum was
’Eard” and the “Fall of Smackerib,” makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>you feel oysters creepin’ up and down the
small of your back.</p>
<p class='c017'>Being a plain person, accustomed to call
a spade a spade, and so hope do not give
offence—I, the undersigned Mary Cheevers,
washer-woman, being called on by some as
I have reason, the dear Lord knows, to love
and reverence, write my plain story in my
own plain way, and with the best of intentions,
though a difficulty with the spelling—Eliza’s
Grace’s Emmeline not being always
handy—and a cramped hand from soaking
in the tub for many, many labouring years.</p>

<p class='c017'>Me and Cheevers was newly married at
the time I am asked to go back to, and in
poor circumstances, but hopeful, Cheevers
doing a small trade in coke an’ cheap vegetables,
and me taking in what washing I
could get, which was mostly that of poor
folks; but poverty will sometimes ’ide a empty
cravin’ under a clean shirt, and all the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>credit I says, as
my motto have
been throughout
my whole life—
and I have seen some ups and downs in
my time—Keep Yourself Respectable.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i003.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Mrs. Mary Cheevers.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>I think my attention was just drawn to
them through seeing ’em so much together.</p>

<p class='c017'>Me and Cheevers lived on the ground floor
in Lemon’s-passage East, one room—and
glad to keep that over our heads—with
the bed kept under the counter in the daytime,
and the sacks of coke and greens with bundles
of kindling and a package of sulphur
matches forming what might be called the
stock-in-trade.</p>

<p class='c017'>You might have expected to see soap, but
there was little if any call for such an
article—except in my way of business—neither
yellow nor mottled, as when only
used on Saturday nights one bar will last a
wonderful time, and who is to blame you
if—your walk in life being a grimy one—you
gets into the habit six days out of the seven
of going grimy yourself?</p>

<p class='c017'>Talking of grime, I never see two poor little
souls more smothered in it than Them Two.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Being boy and girl and always together,
I took it for granted they was brother
and sister, but presently found no relations—and
made the story pitifuller in my eyes,
which Cheevers jeered at as my woman’s
way of taking an interest in anything by the
nature of sweethearting.</p>

<p class='c017'>Bless their poor little hearts! Being not
more than seven year old, when first my
attention was drew to ’em, what could they
know of such a thing? But their being both
alone in the world, and both half-naked—for
such rags I never did see—and both more
than half-starved, brought them together;
and, if grown people find it impossible to
live without something to love and be loved
by, how much more two innocent children?</p>

<p class='c017'>Seven year old, I should say, when first
I began to notice them paddling in the gutter
or sitting on the warm, greasy step of
the fried-fish shop; and though a Jewess—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>something unpleasant in a general oiliness—with
black ’air you might ’a seen
your face in, and garnet rings on yellow,
dirty hands—more honour to her for the
daily scraps she give ’em.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was she who told me their names—for
Cheevers relished her fried potatoes and eels,
though they went against me—and Nick and
Nan they were then, and are now, though
in such different circumstances, as you might
fancy a fairy tale, if not known to be true,
and told by an old woman as owes O! many,
many prayers for ’em and blessin’s on ’em,
more than a grateful heart can ever call down
on them two grateful hearts.</p>

<p class='c017'>So I began by nodding as they passed
my door, and them—with their dirty little
thumbs in their mouths at first—by and by
nodded back; and me, with no more an
idea, that they lived by themselves, like two
wild animals up in that hole in the roof—which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>I would not insult a decent attic by
giving it the name—until Mr. Rumsey
called for his rent on a Saturday, the twenty-fourth
of one bleak December, being Christmas
Eve, and him stopping to pass a remark or
two in a friendly way—for me and Cheevers
paid our rent regular—gave me a turn,
quite surprising by telling me how the
land lay.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The boy was brought here at three year
old or thereabouts,” says he, “by a woman,
who gave herself out as his mother, and
was, I believe, because of a certain likeness
between them.</p>

<p class='c017'>“She had a superior kind of manner, for
all her poverty and wretchedness. The attic
up at the top of this house she rented of
me, on and off, for several years, and I will
say kept up to the mark as far as paying
rent went.</p>

<p class='c017'>“One day, about two years ago, she took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>her hook, leaving the boy Nick, as the lodgers
call him, and a few bits of things only
good for firewood.</p>

<p class='c017'>“These I had took away, but, there being
no lock on the door, the boy still hung
about the place, it being the only home he
has ever known; and a chimney having broke
part of the roof in one windy night, and me—in
regard of these hard times—not caring
to go to the expense of having repairs done,
and no lodgers unparticular enough—even
in this unparticular locality—to take the
place as it stands—there he has stopped to
this hour. How he lives I could not tell
you, ma’am, except that poor people are
more sinfully prodigal as regards charity,
than the rich ones as calls ’emselves philanthropists.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Rumsey stopping to take breath, I
throwed in a question respecting the girl.</p>

<p class='c017'>“She’s the child of Nobody, and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>comes from No Man’s Land,” says Mr.
Rumsey, in his joking way. “The boy found
her and brought her here, they tell me, and
shares whatever he gets with her. And that
ain’t enough to grow fat on,” he says, giving
me a condescending wink.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Nan’ she has come to be called, because
‘Nan’ was her way of saying ‘No’ when
asked if she would like to go away from
Nick and be took care of. I have heard,
Mrs. Cheevers, that the French are in the
habit of employing the same word as a
negative.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Rumsey was a very superior gentleman
in his knowledge and conversation.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Which shows that nation to be a wasteful
nation, Mrs. Cheevers, which takes three
letters to spell a word which we can spell
with two.”</p>

<p class='c017'>And he bid good afternoon and a Merry
Christmas, and walked off rattling the money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in his pockets, as his way was, leaving me
with the tears in my eyes at the thought of
my own baby that was coming, and its
ever being left, poor helpless innocent! as
Them Two, and O how many others! are
left, in this cruel world, under the Eye of
Heaven.</p>

<p class='c017'>And that night, after Cheevers had had
his supper, and a poor one at best, though
he was as cheerful over it, as if it had been
venison with turtle-sauce, I took the candle
and said: “Jem, I am a-going on a voyage
of discovery.”</p>

<p class='c017'>And Cheevers followed me up the stairs,
till we got to the attic ladder, as was that
rotten and crumbly, that he went up first,
trying every step for fear of me a-falling, and
presently nods back at me through the square
hole in the lath and plaster, with cobwebs
in his hair like a Bedlamite, and up I comes,
him lighting me with the candle, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>dripped and flared in the draught that came
through the holes in the attic roof.</p>

<p class='c017'>And there we see Them Two a-lying in
each other’s arms.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“And there we see Them Two a-lying in each others arms.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It was a fine, frosty night, and the stars
shone, through the big hole in the roof
above the fireplace, bigger and brighter than
ever I remember to have seen them. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>now and then a stray flake of snow would
flutter down like a feather.</p>

<p class='c017'>Where the roof sloped down to the rotten
floor-boards was, being more sheltered, the
place where they had laid themselves down
to rest in each other’s arms.</p>

<p class='c017'>Babes in the Wood couldn’t ’a been more
sorrowful nor more innocent than Them Two,
and one could hear their teeth chattering
with cold as they slept.</p>

<p class='c017'>I believe if the boy had had anything on,
except the upper half of a ragged pair of
full-sized trousers, which his thin little bare
arms come through the pocket-slits and the
bracebuttons was fastened together with bits
of old bootlace, an’ so kep’ up about his
neck—he’d ’a took it off to cover the
gal with.</p>

<p class='c017'>She lay with her face on his shoulder and
her thin little hand in his, quite peaceful, and
when a drop of warm candle-grease waked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>her, by falling on her face—Cheevers always
held to it, it wasn’t a tear—she clung to
him, for protection like. And he was bold
for her though afraid for himself, it was
plain to see.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Are you a-goin’ to move us on?” he
says, rubbing his big eyes with his poor
chilblained knuckles. “We ain’t done nuffin’,
not her nor me, and I can’t go away. I’ve
got to wait for mother to come ’ome.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Well, Cheevers and me did what we could.
We took ’em down with us and give ’em
what we could spare, and hunted up an old
tarpaulin, to cover ’em that night; we having
but our one small room, and them, poor
neglected innocents! not being Christianly
clean enough, to keep at close quarters.</p>

<p class='c017'>The next day, being Christmas Day, we
went with a little less, that they might have
a little more, and that bit of roast meat was
the first they had ever put to their poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>dear lips, it was plain to see, for they tore
at the mouthfuls like raging wolves.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Rumsey would ’a had something to
say about the sinful prodigality of the poor,
if he’d ’a seen that sight, but, knowing his
feelings, I never breathed my lips to him
then or afterwards, that me and Cheevers
was doing a friend’s turn for Them Two,
and him, being dead many years ago, probably
looks upon such things with a different
eye, either up or down.</p>

<p class='c017'>And that night by our fire, while Cheevers
was up in the attic, trying to stop up the
hole in the roof, with another old tarpaulin—which
afterwards led to Mr. Rumsey getting
a lodger for the dreadful place, and throwed
Them Two altogether on our hands—I did
my best to tell ’em, in my own ignorant
way, the story of the first Christmas Eve as
ever was, when the bright star stood over
Bethlehem and the heralding angels sang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of peace on earth, an’ good will to all
men.</p>

<p class='c017'>That it was a pinch, I will not deny, me
and Cheevers being but poor folk, when, as
I have said, Mr. Rumsey took the roof, or
part of one, from the heads of Them Two
and let the attic—Cheevers’ tarpaulin included—to
a reduced gentlewoman, who sold
matches at the corner of Gracechurch-street.</p>

<p class='c017'>But we had got ’em clean, meaning Nick
and Nan, and a few poor decent things
upon ’em, and mention of the workhouse
seemed cruel, as the boy had that idea in
him, that strong about his mother—a pretty
mother too! though I never said as much
in his hearing—coming back one day to
fetch him.</p>

<p class='c017'>And so it came to Cheevers starting a
barrow, and taking Nick along to mind it,
while he did business at hall doors and airy
railings. And though in bad weather a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>dreary business, shouting in the muddy streets,
with the rain soaking you through and through,
they did well.</p>

<p class='c017'>I could not undertake to say for certain,
but it may have been because I lost my own
dear baby, after a week of happy mother hood—and
he was a boy—that Nick was
always my favorite of Them Two.</p>

<p class='c017'>He had silky hair with a curl in it, that
was brownish red, like the colour of a new
chestnut, and brave blue eyes, and a white
skin, when I had taught him to keep it
clean. And he had nice ways, and was
grateful for any little thing done for him.
And to hear that boy whistle!</p>

<p class='c017'>I believe the blackbird, at the bird shop
at the corner, died of envy and not of old
age, as they pretended, Nick’s imitation of
him being so much better than himself!</p>

<p class='c017'>But there! I never know when to stop,
when I start talking of my boy—as I used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to call him—and call him now, for that
matter!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“And so it came to Cheevers starting a barrow.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Cheevers was more soft on the girl: a
thin little thing, with great, black eyes and
a bush of black, curly hair.</p>

<p class='c017'>No amount of scrubbing would make
Nan’s skin white; it was brown by nature,
and brown it is to this day. Foreign blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>was in her complexion, as in her ways, and
her temper, which was loving as lambs when
unprovoked, but fiery when crossed.</p>

<p class='c017'>She proved a deal of help to me, that
child.</p>

<p class='c017'>If it had been in these days, both of Them
Two ’ud ha’ been caught and sent to Board
School, to learn to be no use to themselves
or us. But this was years and years ago,
and my boy’s chestnut hair is a handsome
grey, and he an upright, portly gentleman
of forty-two.</p>

<p class='c017'>And she bears her years as well as him,
though not a white hair, and her eyes as
bright as ever. And they love each other,
as true and dear to-day, as they did at
seven years old; it does my heart good to
say it.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c017'>As months went on, Nick said less and
less, but, it was plain to see, he still kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>that idea of his wretched mother coming
back one day; and come back she did, once,
and never no more, for which be thankful,
I said to myself, though remembering what
was said, concerning the casting of stones
at another sinful woman.</p>

<p class='c017'>My boy came into the room, where I
was ironing, with Nan to help me with the
heaters—an’ as willin’ an’ cheerful as a little
bird, I will ever say—one early twilight on
a Saturday in the June of that year, and his
eyes was brighter than usual, and he held
something in his hand, behind his back.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Guess what it is,” he told us; and Nan
and me guessed all sorts of things to humour
him. But at last the cat came out of the bag.</p>

<p class='c017'>Cheevers had took to taking him round
with the barrow, as I have said, and servant
girls, who found him obliging, would often
give him a penny, for the sake of his pretty
face and civil manners—for he’d learned of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>me everything I could teach him, long ago.
And their mistresses, too, would notice him,
sometimes, and he’d saved the coppers all up
and bought—what do you think?—a bright
red ribbon for Nan. And now he brought
it out, all beaming with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c017'>But I soon sent the happy look out of his
face. I’d been ironing all along through a
sultry day, and I was a bit hurt, besides, to
think he’d forgotten me, that had been almost
a mother to him all these months. Sharp I
spoke up—and next minute I could have
bitten my tongue off.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Red ribbons for a child as lives on charity!”
I says, “and looks to poor folks who ain’t
got too much of their own, for every bit
and drop. And you ought to know better,
than to throw away good money in that way,
being in the same situation and owing the
same obligations”—only I spoke coarser than
that—“to my husband and me.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>He blushed up, as red as the ribbon, and
I could see his little heart swelling under his
little waistcoat, that I’d made myself out
of an old bodice of mine.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, mother!” he says, “it was on’y
tuppence, an’ I’d saved <i>this</i> to give you—all
your own!” An’ he pulls out a shilling an’
puts it in my hand, and bursts out sobbing,
and runs away for dear life, and me after
him, full pelt.</p>

<p class='c017'>Down the passage he shot like a arrow,
with his head held down, and the tears
blinding him, so that he runs into a woman,
as happened to be turning the corner suddenly,
and nearly knocked her down.</p>

<p class='c017'>She was miserably dressed, and handsome
in a wild, haggard way, and when she
caught at the wall, staggering beneath the
shock of Nick’s jostle and her own weakness,
for she seemed to be in the last stage of
decline, or something—an’ the last ray of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the smoky London sunset struck full on her
face—my heart turned cold inside me, for
well I knew it must be Nick’s mother.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nick knew her too. There was a light in
them blue eyes of his, as I’d never seen
there before. With that look of joy on his
face, and the tears still standin’ on his cheeks,
I shall see him to my dying day.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, mother!” he says. “Oh, mother!
You’ve come back!”</p>

<p class='c017'>At that she stood stock-still, and stared
at him. Then she thrust out her hand and
caught him by his curls, with a clutch that
hurt him—I could see by the quiver of his
lips—and dragged his head to her and looked
him hard in the eyes.</p>

<p class='c017'>Then she laughed a deep, hoarse, cracked
kind of laugh, and says—but not speaking
like a common person at all—</p>

<p class='c017'>“It <i>is</i> the boy. Why, I thought you were
dead long ago, you miserable, little wretch!”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>At which my blood boiled, and I upped
and spoke.</p>

<p class='c017'>“If he ain’t dead,” I says, “it’s no fault
of yours, as left him to starve, two years
ago.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Which a natural feeling towards her own
flesh and blood, is what I should have looked
for, in a woman and a mother, whatever her
walk in life might be. And a better and a
dearer lad than him, you have treated so
cruel, never lived,” I says, “as I can testify,
as have took a mother’s place to him, for
many a day past and gone.”</p>

<p class='c017'>She frowned at that and turned upon me
fiercely, but her speaking was prevented, by
a terrible fit of coughing, that seized her
and shook and rent her, like one of the
evil spirits in Scripture.</p>

<p class='c017'>When quite exhausted, she leant against
the wall and wiped her face with her torn
shawl and tried to set her tattered bonnet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>straight, with a shaking hand; and all her
hair—beautiful, chestnut hair like Nick’s—came
tumbling about her face. And then—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Whoever you are,” she says, with a lofty
kind of air, “in doing, what you have done
by this unfortunate child, you meant well, I
daresay.” At which Nick, who had slipped
his hand into mine, gave me a grateful
squeeze.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What I did, was done, first for Heaven’s
sake, and then for his own,” says I; “so
say no more about it. Me and Cheevers asks
no thanks.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t suppose, you expect me to go
down on my knees to you,” says the poor
lost soul defiantly, “and if you did, you’d
be disappointed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t thank you. Nor will the child
thank you, when he grows to be a man.
Better far, have let him die, and be put away,
where shame can never come to him. Better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>far, if he had died, when he was born. Best
of all, if I, his mother, had never drawn the
breath of life.”</p>

<p class='c017'>And the wretched creature dropped in a
heap on a doorstep nigh by and rocked
herself and moaned a bit. And then she
pulled herself together, and struggled up.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I must go,” she says dazedly. “I don’t
know what led me back here, if it wasn’t Fate.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have walked days and nights to reach
this place, driven by the same whip that,
now I am here, goads me away. I must
be moving—there’s no rest for me!” And
she turned away blindly and went down the
passage.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, mother, don’t go!” says Nick, following
and pulling at her sleeve.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Wait till you’ve had something to
strengthen you,” I says, as could not help
but pity her; “come home with me an’ I’ll
make you a cup o’ tea.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>But I don’t believe she heard a word.
She brushed past me and Nick, as if she’d
forgotten all about us, and turned out of
Lemon’s-passage, and went down the street,
walking at a good pace. Nick darted after
her in a minute, and I was bound to follow
Nick. It’s a mercy, I happened to have my
old bonnet on, or I should ha’ been took up
for a lunatic.</p>

<p class='c017'>On we went, Nick following her, and me
following him—and turned up by Saint Paul’s,
and so went westwards. The streets got
bigger and more crowded, the shops grander. I
never troubled to wonder where she was leading
us, I was so afraid of losing sight of Nick.
And, by and by, the woman began to go slower.</p>

<p class='c017'>Once she stopped—it was in front of a
grand place like a theatre—and began to
posture on the pavement, and throw her arms
about, and roll out grand-sounding words, for
all the world like a play-actress.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>A policeman told her to move on, and she
turned on him like a tigress.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Move on, fellow!” says she. “What do
you mean? My foot is on my native heath,”
or some such gibberish.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you see these iron gates? Night
after night crowds of people, rich and great,
fine and fashionable, have thronged in at
them, to see <i>me</i>. These walls have echoed
to the voices of thousands, applauding <i>me</i>.
I was their idol then! and to-day I’ve got
to move on at <i>your</i> bidding! Ha, ha,
ha! It’s a funny world, isn’t it, my man?”</p>

<p class='c017'>And she laughed—a dreadful mad-sounding
laugh, and went on, with me and the boy
still at her heels, as she might have seen, if
ever she’d looked round. But she never did.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was dark when she next stopped, before
a great house in a fashionable square.</p>

<p class='c017'>The windows were all lighted up, and
awnings were out, and carpets laid down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>steps and across the sidewalk, for the grand
ladies and gentlemen, that kept rolling up,
in their shining carriages, to walk on. And
a crowd of curious people was gathered by
the area railings, staring at the diamonds and
stars and ribbons, and wondering what was
going to be for dinner.</p>

<p class='c017'>And Nick’s mother—I knew no other name,
then, to call her by—looked up at the brilliant windows
and the open hall-door, and laughed again.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Times are changed,” I heard her say,
quite loud. “Who would think now, that
this used to be <i>my</i> house? Yet those women,
going up the steps, would hold aside
their skirts from the touch of mine, to-day.
Oh, I have done well by myself and others,
and this is my reward.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Take yourself off, you,” says a constable,
hustling her roughly, “or I shall have
to lock you up.”</p>

<p class='c017'>She laughed again for all her answer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>walked away, heading down towards the
Strand this time.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We’d best go home, my dear,” I says
to Nick, “it’s getting late!”</p>

<p class='c017'>But he tugged at my hand and his eyes
looked at me, so wild and wistful in the light
of the street lamps, we was a-standing under,
that I gave in, and we followed on.</p>

<p class='c017'>When the great buildings of Somerset
House rose up before us, I knew where we
were. The traffic had fallen off, the streets were
nearly empty; we only met one or two passengers,
as we turned out on to Waterloo Bridge.</p>

<p class='c017'>The night was very fine and still, and the
great, wide river ran under the arches, as
silently as Time itself rolls on to meet the
eternal sea. Black barges and hulks lay
quiet at their moorings—the yellow lights of
the great city seemed to twinkle, jeering-like,
at the pure shining stars overhead. And
Nick’s mother went on before us with light,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>unsteady steps to the End, that was in store.</p>

<p class='c017'>About the middle of the bridge she
stopped, and began to wave her arms and talk
to herself, as wildly as before.</p>

<p class='c017'>Some of the words she said were plainly
to be heard; the rest were lost in muttering;
and, with the dread, that had been growing
in me for some time, cold and heavy at my
heart, I bid the boy wait where he was, and
went forward by myself and spoke to her.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Poor soul!” I says, “haven’t you no
home to go to?”</p>

<p class='c017'>She looked at me with eyes that didn’t
know me, and nodded her head.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then go to it,” I says, “for the love
of Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c017'>She nods and whispers, “I am going.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then here’s a trifle to help you,” I says,
“and I would spare more if I could, be sure.”</p>

<p class='c017'>But she put my hand away with the money
in it.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“This is the Last Act,” she says, not
speaking to me, but loud and clear, as if
she had been giving orders to someone at
a distance. “Ring down the curtain!”</p>

<p class='c017'>She clapped her hands above her head,
and laughed that awful laugh, and, before
I could breathe, jumped on the parapet, as
lightly as a rope-dancer.</p>

<p class='c017'>I screamed for help and caught at her poor
clothing, but the rotten stuff seemed to melt
in my hands, and Nick’s mother was gone—down
in the black water!</p>

<p class='c017'>I see it all, like a picture, as I write, and
my dear boy a-trying to jump in after her,
and me a-holding him in my arms, and the
policemen that came running up.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c017'>She was never seen again. The river
that has kept so many cruel secrets since
London Town was London Town, and will
go on a-keeping of ’em till want and poverty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>misery and despair, are names that stand
for nothing, took her and hid her out of sight.</p>

<p class='c017'>Her story we heard long after. Let those
that have never known temptation be gentle
in their thoughts of her. Let them as has
knowed it and overcome it, thank the Merciful
Power as made ’em stronger to suffer
and endure than Nick’s dead mother.</p>

<p class='c017'>It seems all this while, as if I was
neglecting Nan. The best of children always,
and the most willing, and helpin’ me at the
wash-tub, with all her little strength, as, even
with my pattens on, she were hardly tall
enough to reach it.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“I screamed for help and caught at her poor clothing.” (<i>Page <a href='#Page_31'>31</a></i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I have said my boy was handsome in his
open-faced, bright-eyed, manly way, and so
he were, but Nan was worth turning round
to look at any day in the week. With her
clear, brown skin and her big, grey eyes,
that would change in colour according to
her moods—an’ she had plenty of ’em!—with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>her bush of dancin’ black curls—as I could
never damp out straight—an’ her red laughing
mouth, and lively, high spirited ways,
she was just Nick’s companion picture.</p>

<p class='c017'>She was over-ruling and high in her ways
with other children, taking the lead in their
games in her hours of play-time, dividing
whatever came to ’em in the way of sweets
and such truck, and making no fuss about
boxing the ears of any big boy as tried to
rob ’em.</p>

<p class='c017'>But she’d break off in the middle of hopscotch
or honey-pots, if she saw Nick a-coming.
(She was wonderfully fond of him and he of
her, as I’ve said before.)</p>

<p class='c017'>She had a high, shrill voice in singing,
you could hear her above all the other children;
and to see her dance, to the organs’
playing, was quite wonderful. It seems strange
to me, looking back, that Nick should have
none of that kind of talent in him.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>But, bless you, then and now he was as
solid as a rock.</p>

<p class='c017'>Looking back again, it seems to me, as
if Them Two brought me and Cheevers luck,
from the very beginning, for before they was
twelve years old, as near as I can guess,
in spite of the call on us, that an extra two
in family must ever make, me and Cheevers
had extended the premises by taking the
opposite room on the ground floor, and was
paying a neighbour, as owned a shed in a
backyard for stabling of a donkey.</p>

<p class='c017'>That was a rise in the world for us, our
getting that donkey! It dropped upon us,
as one might say, from the skies, ’Ampstead
’Eath being so much above the level of Lemon’s-passage.</p>

<p class='c017'>For Nick and Nan were wonderful fond of
’Ampstead ’Eath, and would make nothing of
trudging all the way there of a holiday, with a
calico net to catch tittlebashes in, an’ a medicine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>bottle to put ’em in, when caught they were.</p>

<p class='c017'>I’d give ’em a good slice of bread-an’-dripping
each, an’ could trust ’em to be
away the whole day without drowning themselves,
though nothing more or less, when
they did come back, but a mask of mud.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have heard of strange things being discovered
on ’Ampstead ’Eath in unexpected
places, but that in a lonely part, where there
are sandpits and blackberry bushes, and the
grass grows short and thin, being sat upon
so much by picnickers on Bank Holidays, a
first-class perambulator should be found, with
a stout, well-dressed baby sittin’ up inside it,
sucking its thumb, come upon me as a startler.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We looked all round,” said Nick, “but
not a speck of a livin’ soul was there to be
seen. If any lady had come along, Nan
would ha’ run up to her and asked her: ‘O
please ’m, did you happen to lose a ‘baby?’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But we saw nobody, for a fog had come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>on, and all the people, out walkin’ on the
’Eath, had gone home. An’ somehow, we
never thought of handin’ the perambulator
over to a policeman; the most nat’ral thing
seemed to be, to wheel it straight to you.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nobody noticed us, till we got into the
Passage, and then Old Cutties, as keeps the
whelk-stall, sings out: ‘’Ullo, Nick! I never
knowed you was a family man!’ and some
more on ’em come round and wanted to have
a look at the baby. But we wouldn’t allow
no larks. And now, here it is, an’ what are
we goin’ to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Feed it fust,” says Cheevers, as the baby,
after staring at each of us in turn, opened
its blessed mouth in a hungry roar. “Give
it some bread and milk, and then lay information
at the police station.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The superintendent will telegraph to Hampstead,
and if that child has got such a thing
as a distracted parent a-looking for it everywheres,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>that parent will be down herein a jiffy!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Not in a jiffy, but in a neat dogcart did
the owner of that poor innocent turn up, as
if the gift of prophecy had descended on
Cheevers, and before two hours was past.</p>

<p class='c017'>A genteeler-lookin’ young couple I never
did see; him junior partner in a City firm
of shippers, and her his young wife, married
to him but eighteen months. And the story
of how she lost that baby, deliberate and by
her own act, as told to me, by her own lips
with streaming eyes, was as here set down.</p>

<p class='c017'>Says she, huggin’ the baby, till you’d ha’
thought she’d ’a squeezed it to death, but
that mothers have a way of doin’ these
things—“Mrs. Cheevers, I do assure you it’s
nobody’s fault but my own, and to my shame,
be it said.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dear Alfred,” as was her husband,
“knows, that before I married him I had
literary ambitions, and had nearly written a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>whole novel,” says she, “when our marriage
made me break off at the end of the second
volume.</p>

<p class='c017'>“At first, with one thing and another, I had
no time to take it up agin,” she says, “yet
still the cravin’ to win glory by my pen,
was in me, so to speak. An’ when baby
was six months old, which happened a week
ago, a longin’ came over me,” she says, “to
go on with that story.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So I laid in a store of pens and ink and
paper, unbeknown to Alfred, and began. But
my ideas refused to flow. I could not remember
the endin’ of them people in the story,
try how I would. And this very afternoon
as ever was, I made up my mind to give
up the ideas of a literary career and sink
into contented obscurity.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So, quite calm and resigned, I wheeled
out the baby in her perambulator for an
airin’, an’ just about the high part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Heath I stopped for a rest. If you’ll believe
me, Mrs. Cheevers—I’d no sooner sat down,
than the whole thing came back upon me
like a flash of thunder. I felt, as if I should
die if I didn’t go home and write it all down.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And you did go?” I says, quite petrifacted
with surprise, “and left your baby!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I forgot all about her,” says the young
lady, beginning to cry again. “How such
a thing could happen, I don’t know. But
happen it did. I never thought of her till
I walked in at our own garden-gate—and
then I flew back like the wind. But she
was gone. And now that I’ve got her back—as
I don’t deserve to, being such an unnatural
parent as to abandon my own child—I’ll
burn that novel, as soon as I get home.”</p>

<p class='c017'>So off she went, with many thanks an’
blessings, and her young husband and her
baby, and we heard no more of ’em for
three days. Until a young man in cords come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>down our court leadin’ a handsome donkey
drawing a neat, plain truck behind it.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i042.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“For Mr. and Mrs. Cheevers.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c019'>To our door he brought it, an’ there hands
to me an envelope with</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>For Mr. and Mrs. Cheevers</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>wrote upon it, and inside, more writing—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>From Nick and Nan</span>,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>and a five-pound note. And as Mr. and
Mrs. Hurley, the pa and ma of the lost baby,
had chose this way, so delicate an’ so kind,
of rewardin’ us for the little we had done,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and as Them Two showed such pleasure in
the pleasure of Cheevers and me, what could
we do, but thankfully accept?</p>
<p class='c017'>An’ after that no more shoving the barrow,
with rheumatic pains in Cheevers’ joints,
but a shaggy willing beast to draw it, not
too nice to eat damaged greens or anything
else, when they ran short.</p>

<p class='c017'>While Nick saw to that donkey his own
self, and many a time I have sat behind him,
as proud and glad, as if he was four bays
with rosettes behind their ears, when Cheevers
thought a jaunt as far as Kew ’ud do me
good, and over them tram-ruts is certainly
a stimulant to the liver.</p>

<p class='c017'>Them days were good days, though there
was showers between the sunshine, but of
what came after, others better fitted may
better tell, and so with ever love to both my
dears, always boy and girl to me!—</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i044.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c019'>It is many
years ago,
since I
used to
walk my
beat of a
night in the East-end
of London,
where I was born
and worked my
way steadily up
the ladder of life,
which, if you please,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>is no ladder at all, strictly speaking, but
a double flight of steps. When you get
to the top of one side of this flight, you
begin to go down on the other side, till you
reach the bottom, where a bed is made
for you, and your life’s toils and struggles
are over.</p>

<p class='c017'>I am supposing that you reach man’s
allotted span, and are not called upon to
say farewell to the world, till your hair is
white and all your vital forces spent.</p>

<p class='c017'>This good fortune is mine, and I am
waiting for the summons, with a firm belief
in the Divine message of a better world
beyond.</p>

<p class='c017'>Not that I have anything to complain of;
I have done my duty to the best of my
ability, and if I fell short now and then, it
was not from lack of willingness to do what
was set down for me, but because I had
gone to the extent of my powers and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>unable to go further; up to this point only
can you, with any sense of justice, make a
man responsible. And this, mind you, opens
a wide question, into which I am not going
to enter—the question of responsibility for
committed acts.</p>

<p class='c017'>Under what circumstances you are born,
how you are brought up, by what influences
your earlier years have been surrounded—these
form a succession of lessons, which you
are bound to accept, because you know no
better, and are taught no better.</p>

<p class='c017'>Judges and legislators should take this
into account, and pass judgment according;
though I have observed that a gentleman or
lady, who has broken the law of the land,
is, as a rule, let off more lightly than the
poor wretch, who has not had the advantage
of good teaching and a proper education.
In my opinion, it should be the other way.</p>

<p class='c017'>My grandfather was a night watchman, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>my father stepped into his shoes; and when
he was too tired to walk in them any longer
I put them on with a proud and cheerful
heart, thinking it a fine thing to do, as my
betters had done before me.</p>

<p class='c017'>So that you see there were three generations
of us, and as we were all steady men,
confidence was placed in us. I often heard
it said, “You may trust David Dix; he is
like his father.”</p>

<p class='c017'>In my father’s time, I have no doubt, they
said the same of him. He was a good stamp
of a man, and he gave me a home education,
and taught me how to speak and write fair
English, for which I say “God bless him.”
By so doing, he took the locks off the caves
of enchantment, we find in books. “Open,
Sesame!” I cried, flourishing my spelling
book—and I saw wonders.</p>

<p class='c017'>I had both public and private duties to
perform.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>My public duties mainly were to see that
the houses and shops were properly secured,
to keep an eye on suspicious characters, and
to take care that no place was broken into
and robbed.</p>

<p class='c017'>Poor as were the streets, I perambulated
night after night, for seven nights in the week
and three hundred and sixty-five nights in
the year, very few burglaries took place in
them. Thieves and cracksmen, when they
got to know me, had a wholesome fear of
my watchfulness, and fought shy of the premises
I protected.</p>

<p class='c017'>My private duties were chiefly to rouse
people, who wanted to get up very early in
the morning. A penny a week was my
charge for this, and I sometimes had as many
as thirty or forty people on my books.</p>

<p class='c017'>I bring to mind two memorable nights in
connection with Nick and Nan. The girl
came first, the lad second.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>I had for company at this time a white
mastiff, I called Dummy, who trotted at my
heels, from the moment I commenced my
work of a night, till I got home in the morning
and threw myself, regularly tired out,
on my bed.</p>

<p class='c017'>Dummy was not a nice-tempered dog, but
he never interfered with anyone, who did not
interfere with him, or unless he had, in his
own opinion, a good reason for interfering.</p>

<p class='c017'>He was a faithful creature, and would not
make friends with strangers, and although I
have always been sociably inclined myself, I
did not find fault with him, for this disinclination
for any society but mine. Every man
likes something, that he can call really his
own, and Dummy’s conservative ways made
me all the more attached to him.</p>

<p class='c017'>One night, about ten o’clock, there was a
scrimmage in Chapel-street, and before I knew
where I was, I found myself in the middle of it.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>It was an ugly row between Lascar sailors
and sugar-bakers, and I don’t know which
looked most like devils, the Lascars with
their dark faces and flashing eyes, or the
sugar-bakers, who had trooped out of the
factory, naked to their waists, and with their
matted hair hanging in disorder about their
perspiring foreheads. They had snatched
some of their red-hot tools from the furnace,
and the Lascars out with their knives. Dummy
was in the middle of the fight, and I
was a good deal knocked about.</p>

<p class='c017'>When it was all over, I was some distance
from the spot, upon which the row had
commenced, and Dummy was not by my
side. I went about the streets calling and
looking for him, and after half an hour’s
search, I saw him on the ground, with his
leg badly gashed, and a girl kneeling by him
and attending to the wound.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mind, my girl,” I cried, “or the dog
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>will bite you. He’s savage to strangers.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I knelt down, and Dummy licked my hand.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He won’t hurt me,” said Nan. “Poor
doggie! His leg’s cut to the bone.”</p>

<p class='c017'>And so it was, but Nan had done what
she could for it, and the look of gratitude
in Dummy’s eyes showed that he properly
appreciated her kindness. From that night
Dummy and Nan were friends, and there
were occasions when he would even leave
me to go to her.</p>

<p class='c017'>For some time before this adventure I had
noticed Nan and Nick walking together of
an evening, when I was sitting at my window
smoking my pipe, but I had not paid much
attention to them.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now, however, they had become objects
of interest to me, and I wondered how it
was, that I had been blind to little ways of
theirs which were different from the ways of
other boys and girls.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>They would walk along the streets talking
and smiling—Nick doing most of the talking
and Nan most of the smiling—as earnestly
as if they were the only people in the world.
Sometimes he would have an open book or
a paper in his hand, from which he would
be reading to her, and she would be listening
with all her might, and her eyes would
shine as mine used to shine, when I was
deep in a fascinating story.</p>

<p class='c017'>I discovered afterwards that he was farther
advanced than I was at his age, and that
though they were both fond of Dickens and
Bulwer and Ainsworth, they often read books
of adventure (which were scarcer then, than
they are now) and even dipped into poetry
and imaginative stories of a superior kind.
When we were better acquainted Nick introduced
me to favorite books of his—“Undine,”
“The Lady of the Lake,” and other of Sir
Walter Scott’s poems, and “Marco Polo.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>It was a curious mixture, and how it was,
he came to pick the best books out of the
baskets on the second-hand bookstalls, is more
than I can say; it was a kind of instinct
that was born in him, I suppose, and it went
towards the making, in the end, of a man
out of the common run.</p>

<p class='c017'>What brought me into closer connection
with him, was his coming to me one night,
and saying,</p>

<p class='c017'>“You call people up early in the morning;
I wish you would call me up.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I will, my lad,” I said. “What time?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Five o’clock,” he replied. “I can wake
myself, as a rule, by fixing it well in my
mind, the night before, and saying, ‘Five
o’clock, five o’clock, five o’clock, I must get
up, I must get up, I must get up at five
o’clock,’ and keeping on saying it, till I fall
asleep; but I might miss it now and then,
and I don’t want to miss it once.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Because,” said I, “you have to get to
work at a certain time?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” he answered, “because of that.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And it’s not in you to be a minute
late,” I observed, “as much as one morning
in a month.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t want,” said he to this, “to be
a minute late one morning in a year.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I looked at him in admiration; there was
purpose, there was earnestness in his face,
and there was a glow in his eyes, that made
me take to him more and more, and to feel
almost like a father to him. “This is a
boy,” said I to myself, “that is going to get
on in the world.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ll call you,” I said. “Is it a new place
you’ve got?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” he answered, “and I’m to get
five shillings a week, and a shilling rise at
the end of twelve months, if I give satisfaction.
Then there’s a chance of overtime.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>I nodded. “What time are you due in
the morning?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Half-past seven.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It must be a long way off from here?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, no; I can get there in twenty minutes.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then what on earth do you want to be
called at five o’clock for?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I want an hour to myself, Mr. Dix; there
is so much I’d like to know.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Very well, Nick; I’ll call you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And if I don’t wake,” said he, “please
pull me out of bed, will you?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ll get you up all right.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How much a week do you charge, Mr.
Dix?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My charge to you,” I said, “will be
nothing a week.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No,” said he in a tone of decision,
“that will not be fair. If I work I want
to be paid for it. Please tell me how
much?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Won’t you let me do it out of a friendly
feeling, Nick?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not this, please, Mr. Dix. It will make
me feel ever so much better, if you will let
me pay what other people pay.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I said to myself, “This boy is arguing
out of a spirit of right and justice, and it
will not be kind on my part to baulk him;”
so I told him I would charge him a penny
a week, and upon these terms we settled it.</p>

<p class='c017'>He was never once late. Hail, rain, snow,
or shine, there he was, trudging out every
morning at seven o’clock, with a bright face
and a willing heart singing softly to himself
a favorite song of Nan’s as he went along.
Often he was up and dressed before I went
to wake him, and nineteen times out of the
other twenty he would call,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thank you, Mr. Dix, I’m dressing myself.
How glad you must be that the night’s
over.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>And there he was at his books, every
morning for an hour and a half at least,
with a little bit of candle, if it was dark, as
happy and hopeful as a prince—perhaps
more so, because princes, having everything
they want, must, in my opinion, have a precious
dull time of it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Why, a prince going to his private box
at the opera can’t get a thousandth part of
the pleasure, that Nick enjoyed as, with Nan
with her sprightly step and pretty face at
his side, he marched about once every three
months to the sixpenny gallery at Sadler’s
Wells Theatre, where Mr. Samuel Phelps
was doing his best to amuse, in an intellectual
way, the poor people in the north and
east of London.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Phelps did a power of good in his
day, and there are many well-to-do people
living now, who have the best of all reasons
to be grateful to him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>
<img src='images/i058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“She would go and meet him when his work was over.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Often of a morning Nan would walk with
Nick to the place he worked in and would
leave him there, and more often she would
go and meet him when his work was over.
Being a bright, capable lad, Nick, you may
depend, had many temptations from boys
and girls of his age to join in pleasures
which lead to no good; but he resisted them
all with firmness and good temper, and as
he never preached to them that it was wrong
to do this or that—being, indeed, too busy
to meddle with anyone’s business but his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>own or Nan’s—he did himself no harm by
refusing.</p>

<p class='c017'>At the end of the year he got his shilling
rise, and at the end of six months another
shilling, and with seven shillings a week he
considered himself quite rich. And all this
time he went on reading and studying, and
storing up for the future. It is surprising
what a boy can do for himself in this way.
All the schooling in the world is of small
value in comparison with what an earnest
youngster can teach himself out of school
hours.</p>

<p class='c017'>As time went on Nan’s walks with Nick
to and from his workshop became less frequent.
She was growing in years and beauty,
and she felt that she ought to do something
towards earning a living.</p>

<p class='c017'>There was a little confectioner’s and cake
shop in Whitechapel, opposite the butchers’
stalls, and she obtained a situation there. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>don’t know how much a week she got; it
must have been very little, because the shop
did a poor business, but Nan was happy in
the knowledge that she was making herself
useful. What struck me as being a very
beautiful thing was the pride she and Nick
took in each other, the thoughtful, loving
way in which they would look at each other,
the dependence and trust she placed in him,
the tender and protecting air he showed
towards her.</p>

<p class='c017'>It did not occur to me that they were
too much in each other’s company, and that
Nan’s beauty was a dangerous possession;
if it had, I don’t think it would have troubled
me, so strong was my belief in Nick’s
honesty and straightforwardness, and in Nan’s
sense of what was right.</p>

<p class='c017'>Once a week Nick had to work till nearly
midnight, and Nan took it into her head to
go and meet him on his way home.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>I spoke to Nick about it, and said it was
hardly safe, for a young and pretty girl like
Nan, to be out by herself at such an hour.
There were rough characters living round
about, and when they had had too much to
drink, it was as well to give them a wide
berth. Nick, in his turn, spoke to Nan,
and bade her not to venture out alone so
late at night. He told her in my presence,
but she pleaded so hard to be allowed to
go and meet him that I saw he was wavering,
and would give way, so I said,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, you shall go, Nan; but not alone.
Dummy shall go with you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>They both thanked me gratefully, and
Nick and I felt easier in our minds. As
for Nan, she never had any fear.</p>

<p class='c017'>The sense of that dog! On the nights
he was told off to do duty and take care
of Nan, there he was ready, and he trotted
by her side, every nerve in his body alert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>with watchfulness, and with a wicked look
in his eyes which boded ill to the evilly
inclined. When Nan and Nick met, he
would leave them and come back to do
duty and take care of me. Faithful old
Dummy! Little did we think that we had
pronounced his doom.</p>

<p class='c017'>He was with Nan—on a Thursday night
it was—and it was nearer twelve than eleven,
when I heard screams for help ringing through
the air and, immediately upon the screams,
the howling of a man in pain.</p>

<p class='c017'>I ran quick to the spot, and there was
Nan, white and nearly fainting, and a man—a
beast rather—and Dummy struggling together.
At the same moment Nick came running
round the corner, and flew to Nan and
caught her in his arms.</p>

<p class='c017'>The ruffian, it seemed, had suddenly darted
forward and seized Nan, and Dummy, without
so much as a growl, had leaped up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>fixed his teeth in the brute’s throat. There
they lay rolling on the ground, and as I
did not wish the dog to kill the villain, I
called him off. Dummy relaxed his hold,
and as he did so, the brute pulled out a
knife and plunged it into the dog’s body.
Poor old Dummy! He gave a convulsed
gasp, and rolled over.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, Dummy, poor Dummy!” cried Nan,
throwing herself by his side, and raising his
head to her lap. “Are you hurt much?”</p>

<p class='c017'>The faithful creature lifted his eyes to her
face, then turned them to me, and fell back
dead!</p>

<p class='c017'>How we all grieved, Nan most of all. She
sobbed, as though her heart was breaking,
and I kept my own feelings in check so as
not to make her worse. I could not leave
my duties, and they carried the devoted creature
to my lodgings, and remained up with
him all the night, till I came home.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“It is a brave
death,” I said
to Nan, and
did my best to
comfort her.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i064.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“She sobbed as though her heart was breaking.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We buried
Dummy the next night, and you may guess
how I missed him. You may guess, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>how much closer this sad event drew us to
each other. On every Sunday afternoon now,
Nick and Nan would come to tea with me,
and the hours we spent together were to
me the happiest in the week. Nick read to us
the books he loved best, and would talk of them
in a way it would have surprised you to hear.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Nick and Nan would come to tea with me.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>He was an ambitious lad and wanted,
when he was grown quite to man’s estate,
to be something better than the promise of
his surroundings held out. He did not know
exactly how to put in words his ideas of
what he wished to be, for they were crude
and unformed, but the yearning was in him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And whatever I become,” he said, “Nan
is to be with me always, and to share my
lot. It may be good, it may be bad, but
we are to be always together.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, Nick,” said Nan, softly, “I could
not be happy without you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nor I without you, Nan,” he said, with
serious tenderness.</p>

<p class='c017'>They were approaching that wonderful
change in life, when the boy realizes that he
is a man, and the girl that she is a woman.
Then the world takes a different colour.</p>

<p class='c017'>There is a new light in the sky, a new
meaning in the song of birds and the kiss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of the summer’s breeze. All that is brightest
and most beautiful rises to the surface, and
stirs with solemn significance the pulses of
those whose hearts are attuned to what is
highest and best in Nature. It is not all
joy; touches of sadness come in when we
begin to understand things aright; and it is
out of those new experiences that the angel
of Pity is born.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was so with Nick and Nan. I bring
to mind the last Christmas Eve we spent
together. Before another Christmas came
round, there was a woeful change in their
fortunes, and dark clouds had settled upon
their young lives.</p>

<p class='c017'>I had called the hour—eleven o’clock—when
Nick and Nan joined me unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Christmas Eve, Mr. Dix,” said Nick.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, Nick,” said I, “Christmas Eve.
What brings you out?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We thought we would like to pass an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>hour with you,” said Nick, “and walk
about a bit.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall be glad of company,” I said, and
so we walked on, talking of Christmas and
what it meant.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan pressed something into my hand. It
was a pipe; I have it now.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nick pressed something into my hand. It
was a packet of tobacco; that is smoked
long years ago, but I can see, even at this
distant day, what brought a touch of sacred
tenderness into my feelings for them, as the
curling wreaths of smoke from their Christmas
gifts floated in the cold air.</p>

<p class='c017'>A light snow was falling, but they did not
mind that; nor did I. The stars were
shining, and the moon came into the sky as
the Christmas bells were ringing. We stopped
and listened, and, cold as it was and poor as we
were, something of the sweetness of the time
entered our hearts, and we were gratefully happy.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>A woman, in rags, passed us, shivering
and muttering to herself. She stopped, as
she saw us.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hullo, Mr. Dix,” she said, through her
chattering teeth, and her voice sounded like
a mixture of sobs and groans, “a Merry
Christmas to yer! It <i>is</i> a Merry Christmas,
ain’t it? Oh, <i>wot</i> a Merry Christmas it is!”</p>

<p class='c017'>She stumbled past us, shuddering with
cold, hugging misery to her breast in defiant
despair.</p>

<p class='c017'>I knew her. She was an unfortunate.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan looked after her, and a little sob
came into her throat. Suddenly she ran
from us towards the living emblem of human
sorrow, shame, and woe. We followed
slowly, divining the impulse that led her on.</p>

<p class='c017'>We saw her take the woman’s hand, we
saw the woman try to snatch it away, but
Nan held it fast. Standing a little apart
from them, we saw that Nan was speaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>tenderly; the light shone upon her upturned
face, and, as the woman’s eyes rested upon
it, the hard, rebellious look softened; her
lips quivered, and her limbs trembled so,
that she could hardly keep herself from
falling.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan took out her poor, common purse,
and pressed a coin or two into the woman’s
hand. God knows it could have been very
little, perhaps sixpence or eightpence, but
had it been wealth untold, it would not have
enhanced the sweetness of the act.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thank yer, miss,” we heard the woman
say. “I can pay for a bed now. God
bless yer!”</p>

<p class='c017'>There were tears on Nan’s face, when
she joined us. We walked on in silence for
many minutes. Then Nick put his arm
round Nan’s neck and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear Nan!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dear Nick!” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Well, that was very nearly the last I had
to do with them as boy and girl. Before
the New Year I was laid up in a hospital
with rheumatic fever, and remained there a
good many months. Some part of the time
I was delirious, and the last Christmas Eve
I had spent with Nick and Nan came back
to my fevered mind in all sorts of ways,
and I never saw Nan’s sweet phantom face,
that it did not soothe me and ease my pain.
When I got about, I heard news that cut
me to the heart. What it was, I must leave
to another to relate.</p>

<p class='c016'>IT’S many a time and oft, as I’ve been had
up in the police courts and ordered by the
beaks to stand forward and narrate on oath
all I had seen or heerd on concerning certain
strange circumstances, as had come
across my path whilst on dooty. And I
never made no bones about it neither, but
spoke up, bold and true, for it seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>come nateral like, and all in the way of the
perfession.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Charles Challice, 999 X.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But when a man is called upon, at my
age, to give the perticulars of the most tenderest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>memory of his life, it don’t come so
easy, and if these here words as I’m about
to put down is to be printed and published,
and happen to fall into my missus’s hands,
why, the Lord help me! for I shall never
hear the end of it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Howsomever, it’s been put to me, as my
testimony is needed to complete the history
of the life of a young woman, as was once
a great friend of mine, and so I won’t refuse
to give that testimony, though the doing of
it may go to scrape the ashes off a fire, as
was kindled twenty-eight years ago.</p>

<p class='c017'>Twenty-eight years ago! Only to think
of it, and yet I can remember everything as
took place then, as plain as if it happened
yesterday, though I’m a married man now,
with six boys and gals round me a-growing
up to men and women as fast as they can
do it.</p>

<p class='c017'>First there’s my Charley, a fine strapping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>young feller, as will be in the Force with
me before long; and then his sister Maggie,
as was married more than three months ago;
and little Annie, in the Telegraph Office,
who’s keeping company with the brewer’s
young man. And after them come three
youngsters, all in the Board School as yet
(though it’s little enough, they’ll learn there
to be any use to them), and the youngest is
eight year old, so you may suppose their
mother and I are no chickens.</p>

<p class='c017'>Though my wife’s a comely woman still
and a good woman into the bargain (if her
tongue was a bit shorter), still she’s a hard
worker and she means well by all of us,
and she has a nice red and white skin and
a plump figger as any man might be proud of.</p>

<p class='c017'>Yet, would you believe it, that sometimes,
after all these years, as I’m sitting opposite
to her at the table and thinking what a fine,
well-kept woman she is, her chestnut hair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and her blue eyes and white skin seems all
to fade away from me, and I sees instead
of them a thin, almost a pinched, little face,
with pale cheeks and large, dark eyes, like
two stars glowing in the sky at night, and
a tangle of black curls falling all about a
young gal’s neck.</p>

<p class='c017'>And when that vision (or whatever you
likes to call it) rises before me, I feel as if
the food I was eating would choke me, and
I’m forced sometimes to make an excuse to
rise from the table, in order to sweep the
back of my hand across my eyes. And yet
it all happened eight and twenty years ago,
and she’s a lady now, and rides in her
carriage.</p>

<p class='c017'>Well, well! we mortals are fools at the
best, and I suppose I’m not behind my
neighbours. But I must tell you the story,
and then you can judge for yourself.</p>

<p class='c017'>Twenty-eight years ago, I was four and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>twenty years of age, and had not long entered
the Force. I believe I was a tolerably good-looking
chap, at least the women used to
tell me so. I know I was strong and big,
measuring forty-eight inches round the chest,
and standing six foot two in my stocking
feet. But I didn’t think much about women
in those days.</p>

<p class='c017'>People make great mistakes about policemen.
The comic papers print so much fun
about the cooks and rabbit pies, that the
public take it all for gospel. But, that ain’t
the ambition of all of us. I can speak for
myself that, in the days that I was young,
I wouldn’t have looked at a cook as was a
cook in the way of sweethearting. Cooking
is an art as comes by experience, and though
I liked a good dinner as well as any
man, I couldn’t have gone to the length
of making love to a greasy old woman in
order to get it, nor I wouldn’t have accepted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>what wasn’t hers to give away, neither.</p>

<p class='c017'>I was brought up by my sister Margaret
(having lost my poor mother, before I could
remember her), and the first thing she taught
me was never to lie and never to steal, and,
thank God, I’ve not forgotten the lesson.</p>

<p class='c017'>Margaret’s a good woman, the best I’ve
ever known, and if I’m found on the right
hand, at the last day, it will be all due to
her. As soon as father was dead and didn’t
want her no more, and she had got me
into the Force, she went for a hospital nurse,
and at the time I speak of was going on
nicely and giving great satisfaction to the
doctors. Whenever she could get an hour’s
leave I used to try and get leave too, to go
and meet her, and if it was impossible she
would come down to my beat and stand
in one place, maybe for half a day at a
time, only to exchange a few words with
me as I passed backwards and forwards.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>And I didn’t loiter on my beat those times,
I can tell you!</p>

<p class='c017'>I loved my sister Margaret as much as
she loved me, and her cheery face and
words was better for me to see and hear
than those of any woman—leastways till I
met Nan. And this is how I met her.</p>

<p class='c017'>In those days my beat lay up Whitechapel way,
and a nasty neighbourhood it is, particularly
at night time—full of thieves and drunkards,
and not fit for a decent woman to pass through.</p>

<p class='c017'>Hardly a night passed without some serious
row. The men thought no more of sticking
their knives into each other, than of swearing,
and as for the females—well, I was pretty
case-hardened by that time, but it turned my
blood cold to hear those females go on at
one another and the men!</p>

<p class='c017'>I used to think sometimes, as I pushed
my way amongst them, that hell itself couldn’t
be worse them they was.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Well! there was a little baker’s and sweet
stuff shop in those days, standing not far
from the theayter, and sometimes I’d turn
in there to get something to eat, for I was
growing still and could stow away any
amount of food. And behind that there
counter, in that there common little shop, I
seed the most beautiful young woman as
ever my eyes fell on.</p>

<p class='c017'>Not one of your red and white beauties
at all, mind ye! None of your yellow-haired
buxom gals, with broad shoulders and a
pinched-in waist.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the contrairy, she was very thin and
slight, with a figure like a willow wand, and
a soft, brown skin without a bit of red in
it, except on her scarlet lips. But her hands
and feet were as small as small could be,
and her eyes!</p>

<p class='c017'>Well, <i>I</i> never seed such eyes before or
after! They was like two glowing lamps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>set in her face, and her hair was like a
black silk, curling all over her head and
shoulders!</p>

<p class='c017'>She <i>was</i> a beauty—well-made and clean
cut, from the crown of her head to the
soles of her feet. She seemed very poor to
me, for she was worse clad, than ever I’d
seen my sister Margaret, and we was humble
folk.</p>

<p class='c017'>Her black dress was patched in several
places, and more brown than black, but I
noticed how beautiful her hair was kept, and
that she generally contrived to have a bit of
clean white frilling round her neck. She
was mostly grave and serious when she was
serving me, but if anything made her laugh—and
I could see she had a merry soul by
nature—Lord, how beautiful her mouth would
be! Well, I fairly fell in love with that gal.</p>

<p class='c017'>I went into the little shop as often as I
could, and I fell to dreaming of her on my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>beat, and to watching her, as she went in
and out. She didn’t live there, for I often
saw her arrive at about seven in the morning,
sometimes with her poor thin shawl
wet through with the rain, and with never
an umbrella, which went to my heart; and
sometimes, when she left off work (which
was never till late) a lad, whom I took to
be her brother, used to wait outside for her,
but oftener she went home alone.</p>

<p class='c017'>The reason I took the young man to be
her brother was, not only, because they
were much of an age, but, because she
always seemed so pleased to see him and
used to kiss him on the face right before
everybody, and tuck her arm under his and
go off singing, as if she was a queen.</p>

<p class='c017'>Not that the lad resembled her at all, for
he had hair and eyes more of my colour
than hers, and a fair, clean complexion.
But he seemed no better off—just a rough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>working lad in fustian and corderoys—and I
put them down as some labourer’s children,
and fell to wondering, if she would think a
policeman’s wages enough, to keep a decent
home on.</p>

<p class='c017'>From seeing her so often and thinking of
her so much, I come to seem to know her
as a sort of friend, and I always said “Good
evening, Miss,” when she passed me. And
she would look up with those wonderful eyes
of hers, and answer “Good evening, officer!”
in a voice like music.</p>

<p class='c017'>You know we policemen like to be called
“officer!” It sounds higher and more important
like, and when Nan said it, it sounded
sweeter and better than ever.</p>

<p class='c017'>From passing the time of day, we came
to exchanging a few words, but my love
always made me too timid to say much.</p>

<p class='c017'>I longed to hear all about her family and
her home, but I never seemed to get to know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>more, than that the lad, whom I took for
her brother, called her “Nan,” and she called
him “Nick,” in return. “Dear Nick” and
“darling Nick.” Lord! how I used to envy
the feller, though I wouldn’t have been her
brother for all the world.</p>

<p class='c017'>One night, however, I see something that
disturbed me very much. I met Nan at the
end of my beat, walking along home with a
young man of the name of Rummles. Now,
I knew this Rummles well. He was an
ostler—leastways he professed to be one—but
it was only a cover for thieving.</p>

<p class='c017'>He was one of the sharpest pickpockets
in the East-end. All the Force knew it, and
yet not one of us had ever catched him at
it, and we was quite on our mettle to do it.
He was a flashy-looking cove, as could dress
very well, when it suited his purpose to do so,
and there he was, perking along of Nan, and
looking in her face as impudent as you choose.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>It was a sight to upset anyone as loved
her. I <i>knew</i> Rummles was no company for
her, and yet I had no right to say so. I
gave her a look as I passed, as much as to
say, “Well, this is a rum dodge,” but didn’t
speak a word, until I met her again, which
happened to be the next evening.</p>

<p class='c017'>I was looking out for her, of course, but
she was later than usual, and made a dash
to cross the road without warning. I laid
my hand on her shoulder. “Excuse me,
Miss,” I said, “but you don’t want to be
run over, do you? The tram’s coming!”</p>

<p class='c017'>She give a little impatient jerk, and
says,</p>

<p class='c017'>“What nonsense, officer! I could have
crossed the road twice before the tram caught
me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But it’s my dooty to see you don’t come
to any harm,” I answered; “and I wish I
could see you run no worse risk than this.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Is Mr. Rummles a-waiting for you on the
other side?”</p>

<p class='c017'>She turned them wonderful eyes of hers
straight up to my face, and said,</p>

<p class='c017'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I mean as he ain’t no fit company for
such as you, and I was very sorry to see
him alongside of you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>She wrenched her shoulder from under my
hand, and turns upon me quite in a passion,
with her black eyes blazing.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How <i>dare</i> you say that of any friend of
mine? It was Nick who introduced Mr. Rummles
to me, and asked him to see me home,
and <i>he</i> knows what is right for me to do far
better than you. You exceed your duty,
officer.”</p>

<p class='c017'>And with that she darted away from me,
all amongst the cabs and the trams and the
omnibuses, and left me with oh! such a
heavy heart to think I had offended her!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>And from that day she seemed to look quite
gloomy at me, to what she had done before,
and to join that scoundrel, Rummles, as often
as she could. And I think the brute was
gone on her, too, as well he might be,
though I never see her give him any encouragement
except as a friend.</p>

<p class='c017'>Her whole heart seemed wrapped up in
the young feller she called Nick, but the
three was quite chummy together, and I’ve
often watched them go arm-in-arm down the
Mile End-road, laughing fit to split themselves
with merriment.</p>

<p class='c017'>One day our chief, Mr. Bostock, says to
me, “Who’s that young chap as goes about
so constantly with Rummles?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t know, sir,” I answered, “more than
I’ve heard the young lady call him ‘Nick.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Keep your eye on both of them, Challice,”
he says, “for no one, who keeps company
with Rummles, will keep straight for long.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>And yet I dare not caution the gal I thought
so much of against her brother’s friend.
But I watched him, aye! like a lynx. My
eye was never off Rummles, night nor day.
I knew I had but to spot him in the trick
to set myself right with Nan. To gain her
heart and to marry her, was the dream of
my life at that period.</p>

<p class='c017'>If you had told me then, that I should
marry Deborah, with her red hair and blue
eyes, and live pretty comfortably with her
for the remainder of my life, I should have
called you a liar. Black eyes and black
hair was all the go with me at twenty-four.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan was my first love—sometimes I think
she was my last. I was hard hit, no mistake
about it, and she was (unfortunately for me)
such an uncommon sort of gal, with a
Spanish look about her, and such a devil in
her eye, as made it difficult for a man to
forget her!</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Well, I followed my chief’s orders to the
letter, and kept my weather eye on Mr.
Rummles. The brute seemed to be in luck’s
way just then, for he dressed like a gentleman,
and kept his hands, as far as I could
see, out of other men’s pockets. But I
knew I had but to bide my time, to catch
him at his old tricks, and so it fell out.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was a big night at the theayter, the
benefit of the manager, who was a favorite
all round London, and the crowd was immense,
both going in and going out. I had watched
Mr. Rummles swaggering in, when the play
began—dressed up to the nines, and looking
quite the toff, in his own estimation—paying
down his money at the box-office like a lord,
and ogling all the gals through a sham eye-glass.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There you go, my beauty,” I thought,
“and I daresay, if the truth was known,
every copper of your money has come out
of your neighbour’s pocket. But I’m looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>after you, my lad, and you’ll have to be
very clever next time, if you want to do it
without my seeing you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I spoke to one of my pals about him at
the same time, who was told off to look
after the inside of the theayter.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There’s that beauty, Rummles, gone in,
Looseley,” I said. “Keep your eye on him.
He bought a dress-circle ticket.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“All right! I know him well! He won’t
get the better of me,” says Looseley.</p>

<p class='c017'>I took care to be about the doors when
the performance was over, and the crowd
come out. It <i>was</i> a crowd!</p>

<p class='c017'>A lot of swells had come over from the
West-end to show their respect for the manager,
and we couldn’t find cabs enough for them.
I was standing on the kerb, hailing the hansoms
one after the other, when I see a
gentleman cross the road, to get one for
himself on the other side.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>He was a middle-aged man, very handsome
and dignified in appearance, and well
dressed. We policemen see so much of all
sorts that we know a well-dressed man at
a glance.</p>

<p class='c017'>This gentleman had a black cloth cape
cloak over his evening clothes, all lined with
black satin, and as it flew open I could see
the glitter of his gold watch chain, and the
flash of the diamond solitaire in his shirt
front. He had hailed a hansom, and was
standing by the wheel telling the driver, I
fancy, where to go to, when another man
rushed across the road and thrust himself
in front of the gentleman, crying out, “Hi!
cabby, are you engaged?”</p>

<p class='c017'>The cabman said “Yes,” and the first
gentleman jumped into the cab and drove
off; but not before I had seen the other pass
his hand quickly under the loose cape and
draw out something, that glittered for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>moment as he thrust it in his own pocket.</p>

<p class='c017'>As he did so, the cab dashed out of sight,
and he turned his face towards the lamplight.
I recognized Rummles, and guessed at once
that he had taken the gentleman’s watch. I
was after him like a streak of lightning. “I
saw you this time, my lad,” I cried, as I
cut across the road, and at the sound of
my voice he began to run.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lord! how that fellow did run! Talk of
greased lightning! It wasn’t in it with Rummles.
He went like a hare down the
Mile End-road, darting in and out of the
crowd, and doubling, whenever I gained upon
him.</p>

<p class='c017'>One moment I would think I had lost
him altogether, and the next, I would see
him scudding before the wind on the opposite
side of the way.</p>

<p class='c017'>At last, when I was almost inclined to
give up the chase, who should I come upon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>outside the Aldgate Station, but my gentleman
himself, leaning—as free and easy as
you like—against the wall, not a bit blown,
but quietly striking a match on the heel of
his boot to light his cigar with, whilst Nick
and Nan, who seemed to have been to the
theayter too, was standing by, talking and
laughing with him. I grasped him pretty
roughly by the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So I’ve caught you at last!” I said, as
I give him a shake. “Now! just hand over
that watch, will you, and come along to the
station with me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What watch?” he says, looking as innocent
as a child.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The watch I see you take from the
gentleman’s pocket,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s no good shirking it! I seed you
with my own eyes, and you don’t get off
this time, I can tell you, my beauty.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“All right!” he says. “Search my pockets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and take the watch for yourself, copper!
I can’t say fairer than that, can I!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Looseley, who had joined in the chase,
had come up with us by that time, and
together we rummaged the whole of Rummles’
clothes. But not a sign of the watch
could we find anywhere. And yet I knew
I had not been mistaken, but had seen the
glimmer of the gold chain in his hand.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Go on!” exclaimed Rummles, sarcastically;
“why don’t yer take the ticker out?
What’s the trouble? P’r’aps it’s in my boots
or up the sleeve of my coat! You’re a fine
copper, you are, not to be able to shake
it out.”</p>

<p class='c017'>But though we did look in his boots and
up his sleeves and all over him, we couldn’t
find the watch. I began to think my eyes
had deceived me, but Looseley, who was a
much older hand than myself, was not a bit
put out.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“He’s got accomplices,” he said; “they
all have, and he’s passed it on to one of
his pals. Don’t you let go of him, Challice,
and I’ll search this young man and woman,”
pointing to Nick and Nan, who were standing
by, open-mouthed with horror at the
accusation we had made against Rummles.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, no, Looseley, it ain’t either of them.
I know these young people,” I says quickly,
“and they’re quite respectable.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“All the same I’ll search them,” replied
Looseley, and as he was my senior I had
no power to stop him. But, as he approached
Nan (who was shrinking back against the
wall), Nick sprang at him like a young lion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Don’t you dare to lay a finger on that
young woman,” he cried, “or I’ll fell you to
the ground.”</p>

<p class='c017'>We should have laughed at such a threat
from a stripling to Looseley, who was one
of the strongest men in the Force, only as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the lad sprang forward, we could all hear
distinctly the rattle of some metal in his coat-pocket.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, suppose I take you first, my young
cockerel,” said Looseley, as he thrust his
hand into the pocket, and drew forth a gold
watch and chain.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think we’ve got hold of the right thing
and the right man this time,” he continued,
as he clapped the darbies on Nick’s wrists.
For a moment we was all taken so much by
surprise, that we hadn’t a word to say, but
Rummles was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well! what’s all yer blooming row come
to?” he exclaimed. “What price for my
stealing watches now, eh, copper? My friend
here’s been to the theatre as well as me, but
I ain’t responsible for his actions, and yer
can’t make me so.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They was together, and you mistook one
for t’other,” said Looseley to me, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“They was <i>not</i> together,” I answered firmly,
“I haven’t seen Nick before, to-night. This
chap, Rummles, was the only one near the
hansom, and I see him rob the gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Anyway, I took this fellow red-handed,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! no, no!” cried Nan, who had found
her tongue at last. “Officer, you know
Nick and you know me! We wouldn’t do
such a thing. We’ve been sitting quietly in
the gallery all the evening, and walked straight
down here. Oh, Mr. Challice, speak for
Nick. Don’t let them think he could do such
an awful thing. Don’t let them take him
away. Oh, Mr. Challice! do be our friend
and speak for us!”</p>

<p class='c017'>She sobbed, as if her heart would break,
and I wished to the bottom of mine, that I’d
never been on the look-out to catch Rummles.
But there it was, you see. The watch wasn’t
in <i>his</i> pocket and it was in Nick’s, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the Law goes by facts and not by fancies.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What are we to do?” I asks of Looseley
aside.</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Do?</i>” he answers. “There’s only one
thing to do! March ’em both off to the
station and have ’em up before the beaks
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan give such a scream at that, that my
heart felt like water within me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nan,” says Nick, very white, but very
quiet like, “for <i>my</i> sake don’t make a disturbance!
It can’t do any good! I <i>didn’t</i> take
the watch, <i>you</i> know that, and the truth must
win. Let me go quietly, dear, and you go
home as fast as you can, and I’ll come and
tell you all about it as soon as the matter
is settled! God bless you, Nan!”</p>

<p class='c017'>And he held his white face to hers, and
she clung round him and kissed him in a
way that brought the water into my eyes;
and I couldn’t help speaking to her.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>“Cheer up, my dear!” I says, “depend
upon it, it will be all set right, and we shall
find an explanation for the mystery.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i099.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“God bless you, Nan!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, let me go with him,” she cried,
“dear Mr. Challice! He will be so lonely
and unhappy by himself. Let me come too,
and sit by him till the morning.” But at
that I had to shake my head, and Nick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>reminded her she had to give an explanation
of his absence to them at home.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Keep up your heart, dear,” he said
bravely, “a couple of words will set this
right! Go home, like a good girl, and wait
for me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>And so we watched her go sobbing down
the street, with her shawl held up to her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Now, what are yer holding <i>me</i> for?”
said Mr. Rummles impudently. “You’ve got
the right chap, and I’ll thank yer to let me
go!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes! I know I <i>have</i> got the right chap,”
I answered him, with a good shake, “and I
mean to tell the magistrate so, first thing
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c017'>So we hauled them both off to the station-house,
and locked them up for the night,
though I never believed for a moment, but
that I was right, and that Rummles, finding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>himself pursued, had dropped the watch into
the other’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was a very handsome watch, with a
heavy chain, and a gold locket containing
hair. On one side of the case was a monogram,
but so twisted and turned that Looseley
and I could make nothing of the initials;
and on the other a crest of a dragon and
a spear, and some words in Latin that were
spelled thus—“Vivit post funera virtus.”</p>

<p class='c017'>We couldn’t make nothing of the matter,
naterally, but Looseley locked up the watch
safely, and the next morning by ten o’clock
we were all before the beaks.</p>

<p class='c017'>Well! the upshot of that was, everything
went against poor Nick. I felt sure in my
mind it was Rummles as I had seen take the
watch; but when my evidence came to be
sifted it was only a supposition after all, for
I couldn’t say I had seen the watch, only
the glitter—and supposition don’t go for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>much in court. And then the watch had
actually been found on Nick.</p>

<p class='c017'>There was no supposition about that, and
the fact that he was known as a companion
of Rummles went against him. And so the
examination ended by Nick being committed
for trial, and that scoundrel, Rummles, let
go free.</p>

<p class='c017'>When I see his grinning face as he left
the court I could have struck him across the
mouth. But I was powerless in the matter,
and Nick was sent to prison to wait his trial
for theft. When that poor gal, Nan, who
had been in court at the time, heard the
beak’s decision, she dropped straight down
as if she had been shot. Rummles was
going to take charge of her.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ll take the young lady home in a cab,”
he says; “I’m a great friend of hers, and she
would rather I would take charge of her.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No! you don’t!” I says to him, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>look as black as thunder. “You don’t lay
a finger on that gal or I’ll smash you!
You’ve got the best of it this time, my beauty,
but I’ll convict you before I’ve done with
you, or my name’s not Charles Challice.”
(And I kept my word, too, for not three
months after I had the good luck to get him
seven years’ penal servitude, for breaking into
the house of an unprotected old lady and
stealing all her plate.)</p>

<p class='c017'>Well, I had Nan carried into one of the
court rooms, and when she had had a glass
of cold water and could tell me her address,
I took her home. She didn’t speak one
word to me all the way, but when I had
put her down at her place (and a poor place
it was), “Officer,” she says, crying, “shall
I ever see him again?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“See him again?” I replied, trying to
speak cheerful, “in course you will! What’s
to prevent it?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“But how long will they keep him in that
horrid place and when he’s as innocent as I
am? My poor, poor Nick!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! the gaol ain’t a horrid place by no
means, my dear. It’s as comfortable as it
can be, and Nick will have everything he
can want whilst there.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But the disgrace, the shame,” she murmured,
“it will kill him! And when will the
trial take place?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Very soon. P’r’aps in a few days,” I
answered her, for the autumn sessions was
on, and I knew we had very few cases.
“And now you must give up work for a bit,
my dear, and wait patiently here till you
know the verdict.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Give up work!</i>” she repeated. “Oh,
no! how can I? It is all I have to depend
upon now Nick is away.”</p>

<p class='c017'>So day after day I used to watch the poor
darling, dragging her way up to the baker’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>shop, and it seemed to me as if she grew
thinner and darker, and her eyes more hollow
each time I saw her.</p>

<p class='c017'>I used to say a few words of comfort to
her as she passed, but I knew it wasn’t the
time to tell her of my love, for all her mind
was wrapped up in Nick.</p>

<p class='c017'>Only I determined that whichever way the
trial went, I would speak straight out to
Nan, as soon as ever it was over, and ask
her to be my wife, and let me protect and
provide for her to my life’s end.</p>

<p class='c017'>It come off sooner than even I had expected,
but I purposely didn’t tell Nan of
the exact date, for I didn’t want to have no
scenes in court, and thought it far better
that she shouldn’t be there.</p>

<p class='c017'>Besides, I was very doubtful how the case
would go, and feared the worst for poor
Nick.</p>

<p class='c017'>When the time came, and he was brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>into court, I thought I had never seen six
weeks make such a change in a strong
young man.</p>

<p class='c017'>He was white and thin and haggard. His
cheeks was sunken, so was his eyes, but he
bore a defiant look with it all, as though he
<i>dared</i> the jury to call him guilty. However,
right don’t always win in this world, and
everything went against him.</p>

<p class='c017'>The court made very short work of the
case. Looseley’s evidence and mine was
taken before everybody, and Nick hadn’t
nothing to say for himself, except that he
didn’t know how the watch got in his
pocket, which nobody believed. <i>I</i> thought <i>I</i>
knew, but I was not allowed to say so.
You can’t give evidence of what you <i>think</i>,
only of what you <i>know</i>. And all I knew
for certain was that I saw Looseley take
the watch out of Nick’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c017'>The watch was in court, of course. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>had never been owned, and the judge ordered
it to be locked up again until claimed.
But the jury found Nick guilty, and he was
sentenced to seven years’ transportation. I
was standing next the dock, and he turned
an agonized face towards me, as his sentence
was pronounced.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nan!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I will see after her,” I answered, and I
could read the thanks in his poor face.</p>

<p class='c017'>As soon as I was off duty that night I made
a run for her lodgings, and found her sitting
up, pale and mournful.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You’ve come to tell me when my dear
Nick’s trial comes off,” she said; “I am
sure of it, for he has never been out of my
thoughts all day. Oh, Mr. Challice, surely
they can never have the heart to pronounce
him guilty!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dear,” I says very softly, and laying
my hand on hers (Lord, how the touch did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>make me tremble!), “there’s many an innercent
man has had to suffer in this world
for the wrong-doing of others, and Nick ain’t
no exception to the rule. He had a bad
friend in Rummles, and he has ruined his
life. Be prepared for the worst, my poor
gal. The trial came off this morning, and
Nick’s got seven years!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Seven years!</i>” she repeated slowly. “Not
seven years’ transportation?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, my dear. I’m sorry to say it, but
that’s the truth. He was found guilty and
sentenced to seven years’ transportation.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Seven years,” she said again in a dazed
manner, “seven years, and I am only
twenty-one. Oh! what shall I do?—what
<i>shall</i> I do?”</p>

<p class='c017'>She didn’t cry loud, but seemed to be
asking the question of herself in right
earnest.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nan,” I says, emboldened by her despair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“I’ll tell you what to do. Come home
to me and I’ll take care of you! Only say
the word and let me put up the banns.
‘Twouldn’t be a grand home, my dear, but
it would be a clean and comfortable one,
and Nick’s home, too, as soon as he’s out
of his time. And I’ll love you, my dear gal,
faithful and true!</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ve loved you ever since I knowed you,
Nan, and if love can make them seven years
go quicker, why, they’ll have all the help in
my power, and I can’t say no more.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>You</i>, Mr. Challice?” she says in surprise.
“You? Oh, no! Oh, no!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And why not, Nan? My wages is pretty
good and rising regularly. And you shall
never do a stroke of work again if I can
help it. And I’ll be a friend to your brother,
my dear! I did my best to stand his
friend to-day, but the evidence was too strong
for me.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“<i>My brother!</i> Oh, no, you don’t understand,
Mr. Challice! <i>That</i> is the reason.
Nick is <i>not</i> my brother!</p>

<p class='c017'>“He is my dear, dear friend and my lover,
and we were to have been married in a
little while. Oh, my Nick, my darling Nick!
I shall never be the wife of any man but
you.” And with that she laid her pretty
head down on the table and sobbed fit to
kill herself.</p>

<p class='c017'>There was nothing for me to say after
that! I felt terribly cut up over it, you may
be sure, but ’tweren’t her fault and ’tweren’t
mine. It was a misfortune, and I had to
bear it as best I could. But all my thoughts
ran, as how I could best comfort her, and
that brought me to think of my sister
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c017'>I told her all the story, just as if she’d
been my mother instead of my sister, and I
brought her to see Nan, and when she took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>my poor gal in her arms and kissed her, I
knew she’d do by her as she would have
done by me.</p>

<p class='c017'>Well, it was getting on for Christmas by
that time, and, as ill luck would have it,
Christmas Eve was the very day fixed for Nick
to sail from England in the convict ship.</p>

<p class='c017'>That was a nice Christmas Eve for all of
us. My heart was well nigh broken by the
thought that Nan would never be more to
me than a friend, and hers was the same at
parting with Nick.</p>

<p class='c017'>She had been allowed to see him more
than once, whilst he was in gaol, and she
had been terribly upset on each occasion,
but it was nothing to the day when she had
to say good-bye to him for the last time.
Margaret got leave to accompany her to the
prison, for she thought she ought to have
a friend with her at such a trying moment,
and she was right.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Good-bye, my darling!” cried Nick,
straining Nan tight in his arms. “Remember!
I am <i>innocent</i>. And when I have
served my time I will send for you, and we
will begin a happier life in the Colonies as
man and wife.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Be brave, Nan, as you have always been.
This is a terrible trial, but we did not bring
it on ourselves. And it is such a comfort
for me to think I leave you in the care of
this dear, good woman, and that you will have a
good home and protection during my absence.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” said my sister Margaret, “you
need have no fear on that score, Nick.
Nan will remain in the Children’s Hospital
working under me, until she has gained sufficient
experience to take a higher position.
But you may rest assured she will never
want for food or clothes or occupation so
long as she behaves herself. And that I’ll
warrant she means to do.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Indeed, indeed, I will,” sobbed Nan, “if
only that I may feel your heart is at ease
about me, Nick.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“My Nan! my Nan!” he cried brokenly.
“Oh! take her away, Miss Challice, whilst I
am master of myself, and may God bless
you for all your goodness to her.”</p>

<p class='c017'>And so my sister Margaret took the poor
girl home to the hospital, where she was well
provided for and guarded against all temptation.
And Nick sailed for the Colonies,
clad in his convict dress.</p>

<p class='c017'>Poor Nan! poor Nick! I felt for them both
so much, that I wouldn’t have stolen her
heart from him, not if I had been able. But
I’ve never forgot her, nor my love for her,
you see, to this very day. Only may all the
Fates keep this here confession out of my
wife Deborah’s hands.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Dick Bird.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c016'>“GAMMON!” I said to
him. “I’m too old
a bird to be caught
with that kind of
chaff, my fine
fellow. Try it on
with the chaplain.”</p>
<p class='c017'>He gave a kind
of wince, just as
if I’d pricked him
with a pin; and
as his eyes puckered
up, he ran
his thin hand over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>his damp, white forehead, and made believe to
pass his fingers through his hair.</p>

<p class='c017'>But he didn’t, for it was cut as short as a
Frenchman’s, and then he gave a bit of a sigh.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hah!” I said, “that’s very well done,
Number Ninety-seven. Neat bit of play-acting.
Pity you didn’t take to the stage;
but it won’t do for me, so don’t try it on
again. I’ve met too many of your kidney,
since I’ve had to do with this sort of work.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I beg your pardon. I’m sorry I asked
you, Mr. Rowan.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then hold your tongue,” I said sourly.
“Don’t make worse of it. I know you, my
lad. You’re perfectly innocent, of course;
the jury were a set of lunatics; and the judge
who sentenced you to seven years was an
old fool. You’re one of the good sort of
young men, who wants to improve himself,
and likes reading and writing and chucking
texts about.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>He stood there before me with his face
working, and that made me worse than ever;
for I believe I hated that young fellow then
for being so patient and good-looking, and
for never giving me a bit of trouble since
he’d been on board.</p>

<p class='c017'>Perhaps it was temper, too, consequent on
my liver being out of order, for the heat down
south was terrible, and I’d wished myself
back in England over and over again.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was an unlucky time for him to ask me
to be breaking the rules and supplying him
with books and paper, and I flew out at him
and let him have a bit of my mind, as a
lesson to keep him quiet and to check some
more of the gang, for we had about as ugly
a lot taking out there to Sydney, as ever left
England—for the benefit of their country, and
to be inflicted upon the colonists of New
South Wales.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Perhaps you’re sorry for me,” I went on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>like the idiot I was, “and would like to
convert me, and feel ready to tell me, how
much better it would be for me if I was a
convict in irons, how it would give me time
to think of my sinful ways. But it won’t do,
Ninety-seven. Arthur Rowan knows your
sort by heart, so no more humbug with me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Serve yer right,” said one of the gang,
who had been looking on—an ugly ruffian
of a fellow, named Bird, who was going out
for fourteen years for housebreaking. “You’re
always on the pious lay. I told yer it wouldn’t
do. Give it him again, sir. He’s a reg’lar
snivelling humbug, that’s what he is.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Keep your tongue between your teeth,”
I said sharply, as I fixed my gentleman with
my eye. “Who spoke to you?”</p>

<p class='c017'>He gave his lips a slap, and stared at me
as hard as I stared at him, giving me a nasty
ugly look which seemed to say, “Oh! if I
had the chance!” But I looked him down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>and his thick eyelids went slowly over his
vicious eyes, as he turned away; and after
an order or two I went out and along the
tower deck to where the sentry stood on duty,
one of the several always ready with loaded
musket and fixed bayonet, and he laughed
at me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Been giving it to ’em hot?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” I said, “it makes me sick when I
get hold of a sanctimonious humbug pretending
to be so innocent and good. That’s
the worst kind of black I know.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They’re a nice lot.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Deal you know about it,” I growled.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Don’t be huffy, mate,” he said.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Enough to make any man huffy. It’s
all very well for you swaddies just idling on
sentry-go, but you’re too big to have much
to do with the convicts. It would be degrading
the scarlet cloth, but it isn’t too hard
for us warder guards. Wish I’d taken to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>crossing sweeping, or some other respectable
profession before I took to looking after gaol
sweepings.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Look here, mate,” he said, “you go and
get forward on deck where the wind blows,
and have a quiet pipe. You’re out of sorts.”</p>

<p class='c017'>If he had spoken sharply to me, I should
have given him back as good as he gave,
but this disarmed me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, I am out of sorts,” I said.
“Thank ye, I will the moment I’m off duty.
Nothing like a pipe!”</p>

<p class='c017'>You see it was like this. I was at the
Foreland, and doing pretty well, when, more
for the sake of the change than anything,
I volunteered for Australia, so as to see a
little of the world for one thing, but more
especially because I’d had a sort of a quarrel
with my young lady.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was a bit of jealousy, and we parted,
when a word of explanation would have set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>all right; but that word wasn’t spoken, till
the day before we were to sail with a heavy
batch of convicts. Then it was spoken
when it was too late, and I couldn’t back
out. However, we made it up, swore we’d
be true, and broke a ring and then said
good-bye.</p>

<p class='c017'>This didn’t improve my temper, which
never was one of the best, and when I tell
you that we had too deal with one of the
most troublesome, savage lot of scoundrels
ever shipped off, rough weather, a deal of
illness, and my liver—the doctor said it was
going all wrong—you will not be surprised
at my temper getting a bit worse.</p>

<p class='c017'>I never was a favorite with convicts at the
Foreland. I was not harsh or brutal to
them, but there were certain rules, laid down
by the authorities, for the men to follow
out, and I never would let them scamp
anything.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Then, I never made friends with any of
them. If they were obedient and did their
work, and kept themselves and their cells
clean, they never had a word from me; and
I’ll swear, that, whenever a man was really
out of sorts and not bad enough to go into
the infirmary, I always made it easy for him.
But I was too strict an officer for the convicts
to like.</p>

<p class='c017'>Of course I pretty well knew everyone’s
history, and, as I’ve told you, I took quite
a dislike to young Nick.</p>

<p class='c017'>Prejudice? Well, of course it was. “Young
Nick,” I said to myself, “nice son of his
father, Old Nick; and if the law hadn’t
nicked him, he’d have run his course as a
pickpocket, and grown into a perfect specimen
of the swell-mobsman.”</p>

<p class='c017'>That was on one of my bilious days.
For I had not seemed to get over the
knocking about and sea-sickness of the first week.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Then, as we got further south into the
hot waters, the living on board didn’t agree
with me. You see that’s a good many
years ago, before the days of preserved
meat and vegetables; and salt beef—or
horse—and ancient pork out of a pickle-tub,
with pease pudding, constituted all the delicacies
of our season, except the flinty biscuit
and salt butter, which never came welcome
to a man, who dearly loved a hot roll and
a bit of best fresh.</p>

<p class='c017'>Of course, you know I’m talking of the
days when convicts were sent out to Botany
Bay, as they call it, before the Suez Canal
and the great steamers made a journey to
the Antipodes a pleasure trip.</p>

<p class='c017'>Our journey was in a big transport—a
three-masted, full-rigged ship, fitted up with
quarters for the “lags,” as they call ’em;
a good strong warder guard; and a company
of Her Majesty’s Noughty Noughth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>not armed with Martini-Henry rifles, but with
the old-fashioned Brown Bess musket muzzle-loaders,
you know, with bright ramrods, and
each man carrying so many rounds of ball
cartridge, that he had to bite, and a little
pouch at his waist, to hold so many big
percussion caps.</p>

<p class='c017'>Our voyage was round by the Cape, and
then down south, to catch the great currents
and favorable winds; and, much sail as our
ship carried, the rate at which we went was
a regular crawl, giving plenty of time for
the men to get troublesome and discontented,
with the consequence that a couple of them
were flogged.</p>

<p class='c017'>Bird—“Gaol Bird,” as I called him,
though his name was Richard—Dick—Pretty
Dick, eh?—he was one; and you should
have seen his round, close-cropped bullet-head,
and big jaw.</p>

<p class='c017'>If an artist had come to me and said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Do you know of a man whom I could
sketch as a specimen of a regular rogue?”
I shouldn’t have hesitated for a moment—“Dick
Bird” I should have said; “only,
if you do draw him, have him chained up,
and then don’t go too near, as he might
knock you down and jump on you, to finish
you, with his heavy boots.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I suppose, Dick got it into his head, that
I reported him for his promotion and stripes;
and while his back was getting well, he
used to smile at me in a queer sort of way,
as if the cat had got into his nature, as well
as across his back.</p>

<p class='c017'>There were several little things, that ought
to have made me see that a storm was
brewing; but it’s a way with human nature
to imagine trouble and ruin, where there’s
none, and to be very blind where there is.
’Tis our manner to, I suppose, and has to
do with the way we were made.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>I saw nothing, my mates saw nothing.
We were used to convicts, and we did our
duty, seeing that the men did their work,
and taking pretty good care that their irons
were all right, and that our locks and bolts
were well shot home.</p>

<hr class='c018' />

<p class='c017'>Storms break out pretty suddenly down
in the South, where there’s plenty of room
for the winds to work, and one terrible storm
broke out all at once, when we were about
a hundred miles from Sydney.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was one evening after a fearfully hot
day, that the orders were given, for the men
in our charge to be had out on deck, for
the doctor had reported that he would not
be answerable for the men’s health if they
were kept so much down in their quarters,
which were suffocating at times.</p>

<p class='c017'>So the soldiers were called out, and
planted here and there with fixed bayonets;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>our fellows were on duty, of course, and the
convicts were kept moving about on the
deck, while the ports were thrown open
below and everything done to ventilate the
place.</p>

<p class='c017'>I’d been seeing to this with some help,
and was very glad to get on deck again,
to run my eye over the men; and I hadn’t
been up five minutes, before I had one of
the convicts looking at me in a curious
way.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was Ninety-seven, and he passed on to
come round again after a few minutes, and
look at me again in an imploring sort of
fashion.</p>

<p class='c017'>This happened four times, and being in a
better temper that evening, I took a step or
two forward, as he came round the fifth
time, and spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What is it, my lad?” I said. “Want
a quid of tobacco?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“I want to speak to you, Mr. Rowan,”
he said in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” I said, “you always did. You
were born with too much tongue, Nick.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You don’t believe in me, Mr. Rowan,
sir,” he said; “but, for God’s sake, let me
speak to you for a few moments.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What, to beg, or to tell me some cock-and-bull
story, eh?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, sir, it’s life and death to us. It is
indeed, sir. For God’s sake, let me speak
to you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The man’s way was so earnest, that his
words made an impression on me, but I
only said sternly,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Go on with your walk, my lad. You’ll
be ordered below directly.”</p>

<p class='c017'>He uttered a deep sigh, and continued his
march, with his head down, but as he came
round again I said sharply,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ninety-seven!”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>He gave quite a jump at this, and followed
me below, while I caught sight of Bird
watching us as he went by.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i128.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“For God’s sake let me speak to you.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Now, what is it?” I said sharply. “What
do you want?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“You to give warning and be prepared.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“There’s a plot hatching,” he whispered;
“the convicts are going to rise, seize the
ship, and take her to some uninhabited part,
where they can all land and escape.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Indeed!” I said, with a chuckle; “and
how are they going to manage it? I thought
you were all pretty safe.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t know, sir,” he said, “but it is
a fact; and if you don’t mind there’ll be
murder done.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Who will they murder first—you for
telling tales?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I suppose so, sir,” he said in a low,
despondent way. “I was afraid of that, but
I felt that I must speak.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, did you?” I said surlily; “and
pray who’s at the head of the mutiny, and
when is it to come off?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“To-night, I think, sir.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“Oh, to-night, eh?” I said. “Who’s at
the head of it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Nick was silent.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well,” I said again, “who’s at the
head of it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can’t tell you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Don’t you know?”</p>

<p class='c017'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, then, who is it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I cannot tell you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, of course you can’t,” I said contemptuously,
“because it’s all one of your
hatched-up plans to curry favour.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I swear to you it is the truth, sir,”
he whispered. “I heard them talking it
over.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Heard who talking it over?” I said
sharply, but he was silent again.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Be off on deck!” I cried roughly, and
he turned upon me, as if he were going to
throw himself on his knees.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“What can I say, Mr. Rowan, to make
you believe me?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Tell me who are the ringleaders.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I know——” he stopped short. “I can’t
tell you, sir. I will not betray them. I only
tell you, to be on the watch to put the rising
down.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Don’t you be afraid about that,” I said,
with a laugh. “Now go on deck, Nick
Ninety-seven. You always were a sneak and
a humbug. It’s all a flam, and I shall be
glad to get to Sydney, if it’s only to see
your back.”</p>

<p class='c017'>He went on deck, and I walked to one
of my brother officers, a sturdy fellow named
Fraser.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Here,” I said, “Ninety-seven tells me
the lags are going to rise, seize the ship,
and carry her off to an uninhabited island,
to play Robinson Crusoe.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Young Nick’s a humbug and a sneak,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>says my mate. “They’ll have to look sharp
then, for we shall be at Sydney to-morrow
before this time.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then you don’t think there’s anything
in it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Bah! Are they going to try it on now
on deck, and half a company of swaddies
facing them?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Likely!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Down below then, when they’re all locked
up?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not likely that.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s all gammon, mate,” he cried. “Flam
to get in favour.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What I told him,” I said. “Then you
wouldn’t report it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I would if I wanted to be snubbed,” said
my brother officer, with a grin. “Ha! there
goes the order for down below, and they
haven’t riz, mate. They’ll be behind the bars
in five minutes. Not much flurry to-night.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>As he spoke, a little squad of soldiers
marched down and formed up on either side
of the gate, and the convicts came down
singly and went through till all were in; then
the gate was shut and locked, and all was
safe for the night.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No,” I said, in a whisper; “there’ll be
no rising.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not till to-morrow morning, mate, when
it’s time to get up.”</p>

<p class='c017'>As Fraser—a man I’d known for years, as
one who thoroughly understood convicts—thought
as I did, I felt I was right about
Nick’s warning, and that it would be folly
to go troubling those in authority over us;
so I had my meal, and at nine o’clock—one
bell, as they call it on board—I went on
duty with two more; and it was only then,
as I stood in the main decks, looking about
me by the light of the swinging lanterns,
that I thought of Ninety-seven again, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>impossibility of the men making any attempt.</p>

<p class='c017'>For there they all were safely locked up
in irons; we were on duty, three of us—Fraser,
me, and another—well armed; and
only a few yards off there were the sentries
with fixed bayonets, and fifty or a hundred
armed men ready to be summoned, at the
slightest alarm.</p>

<p class='c017'>“All rubbish,” I said to myself; and then
it all passed out of my mind again.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was very hot indeed that night, and all
was wonderfully still, when, as I marched
slowly to and fro, with my keys in my belt,
I began thinking of home and a certain person,
and whether it wouldn’t be wise to stay
out there and ask her to join me, when, all
at once, there was a stifled sort of cry, right
in forward amongst the men’s hammocks,
and this was repeated again and again, as
if someone was in pain.</p>

<p class='c017'>Then came a rustling and a low whispering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and, without recalling Nick and his
warning, I walked up to the grated door.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What’s up there?” I said severely.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Don’t quite know, sir,” said a man,
drowsily. “Someone talking in his sleep,
I think.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Then the smothered cries came again.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you hear there?” I said. “What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p class='c017'>A voice answered from far in:—“Someone
ill here, sir; Number Seventy, I think.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, doctor! doctor!” came feebly, from
out of the darkness.</p>

<p class='c017'>I turned away, to get a lighted lantern
and speak to the two men on duty with me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s that bad soup they had to-day,” I
growled; “I knew it wasn’t fit.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Shall I fetch the doctor?” said Fraser.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not yet,” I said. “He wouldn’t like to
be roused out for nothing. I’ll go in and see.”</p>

<p class='c017'>We warders were so strong, in the belief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of our own power, that I thought nothing of
going in there with my lantern amongst that
crowd of half savage, half human beasts; and
as the door was unlocked, I left my two
fellow warders on guard and went right in,
between the two rows of hammocks, towards
where the moaning arose.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Here, what’s the matter,” I said. “Who
is it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>I have a vivid recollection of the dim
scene, as I asked that question. The darkness
all around, save where the faint light
of my lantern shone, showing the rows of
hammocks hanging from the beams of the
deck above, the fierce countenances gleaming
out for a moment and the light flashing from
their eyes, where all was silent—a peculiar
hushed silence, I remember now, as a hoarse,
rasping voice came from a few feet away from me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! Mr. Rowan, sir, it’s me—Seventy,
sir—Bird, sir—I’m dying, sir—poison, sir.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Here, let’s look at you,” I said. “Don’t
make that row, man.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Haggony, sir—Doctor, sir—an—oh—<i>make
it hot</i>!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hah! You dog!”</p>

<p class='c017'>I tried to say more, but the words were
choked in my throat, for when, lantern in
hand, I bent over the convulsed face, as its
owner writhed heavily in his hammock, two
great sinewy hands seized me by the throat,
I was twisted as it were down upon the
deck, and Bird wrenched himself round over
me, saying in a hoarse voice to drown my
struggles and gurgling attempts to cry for help,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Can’t help kicking, sir. It’s haggony!
but I’m a bit better, sir, thank ye, sir. No,
sir, I don’t want the doctor, sir.”</p>

<p class='c017'>All this and more, repeated, as if in
mockery over my distorted face, as the ruffian
gripped my throat with all his force, while
above the singing in my ears and his words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>I could hear that something was going on
at the door where I had left my two fellow
warders, but what I could not tell.</p>

<p class='c017'>All I knew was, that I tried hard to throw
the ruffian off my chest as he knelt upon
me, that my senses were departing fast, that
Bird would be hung for my murder, and
that I was dying of strangulation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Then, as if it were part of a dream, I
saw the men racing out to attack and murder
the sentries, and make the vessel their own.</p>

<p class='c017'>“All through my neglect,” I thought, as
there were a thousand lights dancing before
my eyes; and then, almost at my last, there
was a violent concussion, a savage snarl, a
cessation of the compression at my throat,
and a tremendous struggle going on upon
me in the dark.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
<img src='images/i139.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Two great sinewy hands seized me by the throat.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Get hold on him, some of you,” came
to my singing ears in a fierce growl, as the
struggle went on. “Quick! D’yer hear?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>We shall have ’em all at us directly. Now
then. Quick! You <i>will</i> have it, then.”</p>

<p class='c017'>There was a dull thud and then a groan,
followed by a couple of shots outside, one
following the other; shots which even then,
half dead as I was, gave me a sensation of
relief, for I knew they had been fired by
the first sentry and the next to spread the
alarm.</p>

<p class='c017'>Almost at the same moment, I felt a warm
gush of something flooding my face and
neck, and with a moan a man fell back
across me, as I lay listening to the rush of
feet. Then came loudly, “Now for it, lads!”</p>

<p class='c017'>There was another rush, and, sounding
distant and strange now, as I lay half suffocated,
I heard a fierce yelling, and above it
in commanding tones,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Halt! Surrender!”</p>

<p class='c017'>But the rushing and yelling continued;
there was the sound of blows, and then twice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>I heard loudly the order “Fire!” followed
by a rattling volley; shrieks and groans; the
scuffling rush of bare feet, and the clink of
irons; and it seemed to me, that the convicts
were running back to their hammocks.</p>

<p class='c017'>Then all seemed to be blank till I was
awakened by the glare of lanterns in my
eyes, and someone said,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Here’s Arthur Rowan, sir.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dead?” said a voice, which I knew to
be that of one of the officers.</p>

<p class='c017'>I answered the question myself in a husky
voice, with the word seeming to tear its way
out of my throat.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thank God, my lad! We thought they’d
done for you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I got a sight now of glittering bayonets,
and through the foul powder smoke, I caught
glimpses of the faces of convicts looking
over the sides of their hammocks.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Turn that man over,” said the same
voice I had heard before, as two men took
charge of me. “Dead, I think. Who is it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ninety-seven,” said one of the warders,
and it seemed to be Fraser.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! Did you stab him, Rowan?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, sir,” I said feebly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Humph! someone has. Twice. Look
sharp, my lads, or he’ll bleed to death.
To the doctor.”</p>

<p class='c017'>As fortune had it, I was carried out, and
laid down on the deck, just as the doctor
rose, from where he had been on one knee
by a figure at my side.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Carry him out, my lads; he’s past my
help. One of you shot pretty truly.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I looked beside me, and caught a glimpse
of the dead man. It was Dick Bird, shot
dead as he tried to escape.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Now you,” said the doctor. “Where’s
all this blood from?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“Not mine,” I whispered, half strangled.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Humph! Whose then? One more.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This was as another man was carried along,
and laid on my other side.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Eh?” said the doctor. “Stabbed, eh?
How was this?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Number Seventy, sir—Bird—knifed him.
It was a dodge,” said Fraser.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dodge, eh?” said the doctor, whose hands
were busy with tourniquets and bandages.
“Rum sort of dodge! What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The men had planned to rise, sir, and
that Bird was the ringleader.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He shammed ill, and poor Rowan went
to help him, to see what was wrong before
calling you. Then Bird caught him by the
throat and was strangling him, when this
poor fellow, Ninety-seven—Nick—out here
for picking pockets, went to Rowan’s help.
He had warned us just before dark, but we
thought it a flam; and now, when he tried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to save my mate, Bird turned upon him and
stabbed him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And got his deserts the next moment,
eh?” said the doctor, quietly, as he tied his
bandages tightly. “Well, Master Ninety-seven
has got two terrible stabs, but we
must save Ninety-seven’s life. Pickpocket,
eh? Not he. The man’s a hero.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I did not hear any more then, for everything
swam round me mistily—faces, bayonets,
officers, epaulets—and when I opened my
eyes to see clearly, I was lying in a bed in
Sydney Infirmary, and the first question, I
asked of the hospital nurse, was,</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is Ninety-seven dead?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No. There he lies across the ward.
The doctor says he’ll get well.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I’d had quite a touch of fever and been
queer for days, but from that hour I rapidly
got well, though for many months my voice
was as good as gone.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>It was in April, when I left the hospital
without seeing Nick. He’d been taken away
to the convict infirmary, and it was in December
that I saw him again.</p>

<p class='c017'>In the meantime, while I lay in hospital,
I had heard from Fraser, my mate, all I
didn’t know about the men getting out after
knocking down and trampling on him and
the other; but the sentries had fired, and
at the alarm the guard turned out, and as
the men refused to surrender, fired twice and
drove them back.</p>

<p class='c017'>I said that my voice was as good as gone,
but it was strong enough for me to report
all I knew, to those who took my evidence
at my bedside; and I can tell you, I laid
it on pretty thick over poor Nick, for I
was mad with myself for doubting the poor
fellow, who nearly lost his life in trying to
save that of one, who had behaved to him
like a brute.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>The consequence was, that Ninety-seven
was sent up the country, as what they used
to call an assigned servant, those being well-behaved
men, to whom a chance was given
to redeem the past.</p>

<p>“Went up the country in a bullock wagon.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Three days before Christmas, I, Arthur
Rowan, having leave of absence, went up the
country in a bullock wagon, pretty well
laden with Christmas cheer for a present,
though the best present of all I was carrying
in my breast.</p>

<p class='c017'>How I did laugh as I went up, for I felt
real happy, and it did seem so comic.</p>

<p class='c017'>Here it was just upon Christmas, and me
with the plums and peel and things for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>pudding, while the sun shone down so hot,
I was nearly cooked meat myself, when on
Christmas Eve I walked up to the shingle and
bark squatter’s house, all amongst the gum
and ti-trees.</p>

<p class='c017'>There was a laughing jackass on the ridge,
a tame ’un, and a great lame kangaroo, and
a big long-legged emu stalked about along
with the chickens, as I removed the rail
fence, where the man, who drove me,
stopped to hitch on his bullocks.</p>

<p class='c017'>But I could see no more for staring at a
tall, manly-looking brown fellow in shirt and
trousers, though wearing his shirt so open,
that I could see a great red scar at the side
of his neck.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, Nick, my lad,” I said in my husky
voice.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Rowan,” he cried, and he quite
reeled. “Don’t say I’m to go back to the
prison.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“But I do say it, my lad,” I cried, “and
at once. Leastwise, we’ll keep Christmas
first. I’ve brought some tackle in the dray.”</p>

<p class='c017'>He didn’t answer me, but I heard him
groan,</p>

<p class='c017'>“And I was so happy here.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Happier than at home, dear lad?” I
said.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What? Home?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ay, and sorry I shall be to see you go,
though I wouldn’t believe you once.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then you’ve brought me news?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, lad, this,” I cried, slapping a blue
paper into his hand. “They let me bring
it; me, the man whose life you saved.”</p>

<p class='c017'>He stared at me, as if he could not hear
a word, and his face looked blank and strange.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nick, lad, don’t you hear me? I tell
you, it’s a free pardon—in the Queen’s name,
though, hang me! if I believe you did that
wrong.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“A pardon!” he cried, “for me!” and
he tore the paper open and tried to read;
then I saw him stagger, but he recovered
himself, sank down on his knees, and held
the paper to his lips.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thank God!” he gasped; and then in
a wild, hysterical voice—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nan, Nan, my darling! At last—at
last!”</p>

    <div>SOME EVIDENCE OF ALFRED CURRAN, NEWS PAPER REPORTER, CONCERNING A PAIR OF TRUE LOVERS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><i>By MRS. CAMPBELL PRAED.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Christmas Eve! Strange that that letter
should have reached me to-day. <i>In medias
res</i> was always my journalistic motto. Plunge
straight into the heart of your subject, and
don’t bore your readers with preliminaries.</p>
<p class='c017'>I was thinking of Nan when Jem Starr,
mail-man, rode up to the bachelors’ quarters
this afternoon, and chucked the mail-bag on
the veranda at my feet.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>He told me to take it to the Big House
and give it to the Boss. Took me for a new
chum most likely—said, he was in a hurry
to yard his horse—said, there was a chance
of the river coming down with floods up at
the heads, and that it was hot enough for
us to be let off a term of purgatory. A
queer independent chap is Starr.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan and Nick! Nick and Nan! But I
was thinking of Nan more than of Nick.
Yes, it is strange there should have been in
that mail-bag a letter, asking me to tell all
I knew of Nan and Nick, and of that Christmas
time at Eungella Diggings, when I was
sub-editor of <i>The Eungella Star</i>.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
<img src='images/i153.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Alfred Curran.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Sounds grand—Sub-editor of <i>The Eungella
Star</i>. It sounded grander still, when Jessop
wrote to me—I was Jessop’s cousin, you
know, and he was under promise to give me
an opening if he could. He said he had
started a paper and struck gold, and that if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>liked, I might come out and run the paper,
while he looked out for more gold.</p>

<p class='c017'>Didn’t I jump at the offer, just! Didn’t
I make sure, that I’d struck gold in my
line, too! Didn’t I see visions of a fortune
and a coming back to England, and a great
Liberal organ started, with all the New
World go, and getting into Parliament, and
all the rest!</p>

<p class='c017'>But it wasn’t for me that destiny reserved
the fulfilment of those dreams. It was for
Nan’s husband. Nan didn’t bring me luck.</p>

<p class='c017'>Sometimes it seems to me, that she
brought more bad luck than good, to the
men who loved her—all, that is, except one.
And there were a good many of them. It
wasn’t her fault. But that’s how it came
out in my experience of that Christmas Eve.</p>

<p class='c017'>Anyhow, my fortune hasn’t amounted to
much. Eungella Diggings smashed up, and
Jessop smashed up, and <i>The Star</i> smashed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>up, too. Things have a way of smashing
up in Australia.</p>

<p class='c017'>And here I am, a hack reporter, glad to
get a job on anything. Bush races or bush-ranging,
prize cattle, or a new cure for
pleuro; “bush naturalist” articles, or gush
over an election; it is all “copy.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Election business, it was this time. Election
finished; “copy” sent in, and a free
and easy kind of invitation from one of the
election bosses—the biggest squatter in these
parts—to loaf about his station and pick up
material, till the Christmas holidays are over.</p>

<p class='c017'>I like loafing. I’m doing a story of bush
life. I’m happy enough in the bachelors’
quarters. My lady squatteress doesn’t encourage
me at the Big House, though I’m
asked there for Christmas dinner to-morrow.
The new chums are “tailing” on an out-station,
and the Superintendent has gone to
town for a spree.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>That’s how I come to be jotting down
shorthand notes of my reflections on this
Christmas Eve.</p>

<p class='c017'>Every now and then, I drop my pen to
go and take a smoke in the hammock in
the veranda, and think a little more of Nan.</p>

<p class='c017'>I watch the Southern Cross, dipping over
the mountains. I listen to the frogs, flopping
from the veranda roof on to the grass,
and to the hum of the flying ants, and the
queer buzzings of the myriads of insects,
and the cry of the curlews down by the
swamp. I see the heat mist rising on the
plain and the lightning zig-zagging on the
horizon, west.</p>

<p class='c017'>It makes me melancholy, a night like this.
Those trumpet flowers give out a sickly
scent, and there’s a Cape jasmine creeper,
twined round a pole, that looks like a ghost.
Sets one dreaming—dreaming. And there’s
a girl over at the Big House singing; and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>can catch the tune and a word here and
there. It’s a singing kind of thing. It
goes—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For the old love’s sake,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For the old love’s sake!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>And I seem to see Nan. The jasmine
reminds me of her, and the pointers of the
Southern Cross are like her eyes. Nan,
with her pretty, pale face and her red lips,
so resolute and so sweet, and her deep,
bright, dark eyes, and her black, curly hair.</p>

<p class='c017'>We came out to Australia together. She
was a second-class passenger, and so was I,
but she kept very much to herself; and then
she was in her cabin a good bit the first
part, and we didn’t get to know each other
till the voyage was getting on.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
<img src='images/i159.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“We came out to Australia together.” (<i>Page <a href='#Page_158'>158</a></i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>She was all by herself, but she didn’t
seem lonely; and she didn’t seem to want
to talk. I’d watch her on deck, reading and
working by the hour together, and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>just thinking, with a happy smile on
her face.</p>

<p class='c017'>She was a great one for reading, and she
read clever books—histories and travels and
biographies, and I would even see her
studying grammars and suchlike. I wondered
why she was so eager to improve herself,
and I wondered what made her look so
happy.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was seeing me usually reading, too, that
made her notice me, I think, and I contrived
to make the books a means of falling
into talk.</p>

<p class='c017'>I offered to lend her one I had, that was
the sequel to one of hers, and it came about
after this, that she would let me sit with her
on deck, and she said she learned things
from me that none else had taught her.
But she had plenty of brains, had Nan;
anyone could see that, though, of course, I
saw, too, that she had not been educated in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the way girls are, and, in fact, that she
wasn’t a lady, as the saying goes.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan was a lady, every inch of her, as
far as Nature went; but she hadn’t the ways
of those “born.” I could see that then,
having my mother and my sisters and the
dear old Rectory full in my mind. Perhaps
I shouldn’t so easily tell the difference now.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan didn’t make any secret of her humble
beginnings. She had been a girl in a baker’s
shop, and she had been nurse in a Children’s
Hospital.</p>

<p class='c017'>I supposed that was where she picked up
her gentle manners. But that hadn’t lasted
long, she said, and she had never had any
time for improving her mind. And she told
me, that her only friends were in a low walk
of life.</p>

<p class='c017'>That didn’t matter to me. I fell in love
with Nan, before we had been talking half
an hour—before, indeed, we had ever spoken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>at all, and I asked her to marry me,
just ten days before the ship landed at
Australia.</p>

<p class='c017'>She refused me. I hadn’t supposed she
would accept me right off. In spite of her
frank cordiality where she trusted, there was
a sort of impenetrableness and stand-offishness
about Nan, which always rebuffed me.
I felt somehow that she wasn’t in love with
me. But I thought that was her way. And
I didn’t expect to find that she was on the
eve of being married to somebody else.
And yet I might have guessed it if I hadn’t
been a fool.</p>

<p class='c017'>That was the secret of her dreamy, happy
smile—of her suppressed excitement as the
voyage neared its close—of stray allusions
which, preoccupied with my own hopes, I
had totally misunderstood. I had got the
impression that she was going to join her
brother in Australia; now I found that it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>her lover, who was awaiting her—her lover,
whom she hadn’t seen for seven years.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Seven long, weary years, Mr. Curran,”
she said. “Seven years of waiting and hoping
and struggling—everything, as it seemed,
against us.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Then she told me something of hers and
Nick’s story; of the wrongful accusation and
unjust sentence; of its remission, and of his
efforts to earn sufficient money to pay her
passage out, so that they might marry and
work together.</p>

<p class='c017'>But people wouldn’t believe in Nick’s innocence,
and in spite of what he had done,
there was a prejudice against employing him.
Then, she said, luck had been altogether
against Nick.</p>

<p class='c017'>Just when he was getting on, his little savings
had been lost; and then he had had a bad
illness, and for a very long while she had heard
nothing, and had been almost wild with anxiety.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Letters had miscarried, and at one time
she had almost believed that he had forgotten
her. But two years before he had written
to tell her that he had his health again,
and that he would never rest until he could
make her his wife. And then had come a
letter telling her, that he had found gold and
would be a rich man—a letter enclosing a
sum for her expenses to Australia.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It seems like a dream,” she said. “I
wake of nights, and I can’t believe, that, in
a little while, I shall see my Nick again.
And then I get afraid that he may be disappointed
in me, and find that, while he has
risen, I have sunk. For I am only a poor
girl, and I’ve led a hard life.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It was all right, while I was in the Children’s
Hospital, and I think they would have
made almost a lady of me there; but Miss
Challice died, and her brother was removed
to another place, and things went wrong,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and one day I found,” she went on, “that
I was turned out without a penny in the
world.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t know how I managed. I got into
a factory and worked there, and after a bit,
I got easier work, but I could never save
enough to be of any use. Ah, Mr. Curran,
if you knew how Nick and I have loved
each other, and how we have looked forward
to this meeting, you wouldn’t grudge us our
happiness.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It went to my heart, and touched all the
best part of me, that girl’s way of taking
my disappointment.</p>

<p class='c017'>She seemed to think it was her fault, and
that she ought to have told me at the first.</p>

<p class='c017'>She asked me to let her be my friend,
and she asked me to go on teaching her
and helping her to be worthy of Nick.</p>

<p class='c017'>It’s only good women that can rub it into
a chap, by saying things like that.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Help to improve her for the joy of another
man—a man probably, I thought then, not
worthy to tie her shoe-strings! But I said
I’d do my best to be her friend, and I’d
love her always. And I think I had a lurking
hope that the other fellow might throw
her over at the last, or that she might find
she had been making a mistake.</p>

<p class='c017'>Of course I didn’t believe all that, about
the unjust sentence. I asked her where he
was, and then it seemed like a fate, that she
should say Eungella, and I told her that it
was Eungella I was bound to.</p>

<p class='c017'>She knew he was to meet her in Sydney.
I knew it, too. And I shall never forget
the wonderful look on Nan’s face, as we
steamed in between Sydney Heads into the
new world.</p>

<p class='c017'>She was trembling all through her little
thin body, and her red lips were parted, and
her eyes were like two shining stars set in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>darkness. “Oh, how beautiful it is!” I heard
her murmur; “and Nick is there.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It <i>was</i> beautiful: the great rugged cliffs
and the sun setting over the barren ridge of
rock, and then the harbour with all its little
bays lying blue and peaceful, and the town
and the forts, and the lovely Botanic Gardens
with their tropical trees and the feathery
clumps of bamboos.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan had never seen such trees and plants
before. But I don’t think she distinguished
anything; I am sure it was all like a picture
in a dream to her. She could think of
nothing, but that she was going to see Nick.</p>

<p class='c017'>I felt her give a little gasp and a strange
cry, as he came pressing forward from the
crowd on the wharf. He never seemed to
pause or hesitate. He knew her at once
for his own.</p>

<p class='c017'>He was a great, tall fellow, with a sunburnt
face, and he had a noble presence—I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>was obliged to
own that. And
he had clear,
blue eyes and
fair, curly hair.
He made me
think, somehow,
of one of the old
Vikings of the
North. I didn’t
wonder that she
loved him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i169.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“He never seemed to pause or hesitate.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Nan!” I heard him say, as she cried
“Nick!” and if I had ever had any hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of change in her or him, it died in that
moment, when I saw the wonderful and
immortal love in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c017'>Love! love, real love! In spite of the
cynics, there’s nothing else in this universe
that endures. I turned away feeling lonely
and sick at heart. I’d had my dream, and
it was over; but I knew that I should never
love any woman as I loved Nan, and when
I saw the two, drawn as it were into each
other’s arms, both uttering that strange
yearning cry, of a longing that was at last
to be fulfilled, I swore to myself that I’d
be Nan’s loyal brother and Nick’s friend, as
long as Fate kept us three together.</p>

<p class='c017'>Eungella Diggings was a wild sort of place
to bring a woman to—a straggling town,
set in a hollow of the hills, with claims all
about, and heaps of mullock, as they call
the refuse after the crushing of the quartz,
and queer, unsightly erections of machinery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>of which the whirr ceased not day nor night.</p>

<p class='c017'>Then there were mushroom tenements of
canvas, and shanties of bark, and weather-board
lean-to’s, and zinc-roofed buildings,
mostly of a public character—the Courthouse,
and Bank, and <i>The Star</i> Office, and the
many public-houses, into which all the scum
of the earth seemed to gather itself. And
some of its aristocracy, too.</p>

<p class='c017'>There was a baronet doing a store business
two doors from <i>The Star</i>, and “Honourables”
were as thick as peas—or Chinamen,
which is saying much the same thing at the
Diggings.</p>

<p class='c017'>There were all sorts, mostly scamps; and
fine, daredevil scamps they were that went
out to Australia in those days. Many are
the stories I could tell, if I hadn’t to tell
that of Nick and Nan, about the Diggings
crew.</p>

<p class='c017'>There were lags, too, of course—old hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>as bad as you make ’em, and rough miners
as honest as you make ’em, and Oxford and
Cambridge men, and army swells, that you’d
expect to see in London drawing-rooms.</p>

<p class='c017'>There were women, too, of all sorts—the
worst and the best; and drink flowing, and
divine bank-notes flying, and knives gleaming,
and tomahawks and pistols at men’s belts.</p>

<p class='c017'>I often wondered what Nan thought of it
all, and if things startled her as much as
they sometimes did me. Perhaps it was a
good thing for me, that I had the new work
and the queer experiences and the “copy”
to think of; they helped me to reconcile myself to
my disappointment, though I never saw Nan
and Nick without a nasty pain at my heart,
and at first I rather avoided seeing them at all.</p>

<p class='c017'>I cannot think why Nick didn’t marry
Nan straight off—why he hadn’t married her
in Sydney, when she arrived, and brought
her to Eungella as his wife.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>He was rich enough. He had a good
claim, and was turning out gold hand over
hand. I believe that was what he wanted
and intended, but Nan had some romantic
notion that she wasn’t educated enough to
be his equal, and that it would be right of
her to give him a little time before the knot
was irrevocably tied, so that he might be
quite certain of his own mind.</p>

<p class='c017'>She was a noble creature, and I am not
sure that she wasn’t right. And she wouldn’t
take any more money from Nick, but insisted
on working for herself. She talked it over
with the doctor’s wife, and they got her
nursing jobs to do, and she was called there,
as she had been called in the hospital, she
said, “Sister Nan.”</p>

<p class='c017'>There was sickness enough at Eungella—accidents
in the mines, and touches of fever
and sunstroke cases as the great heat came
on. It was early in November when we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>got to Eungella, and hot indeed then. But
that heat was nothing to what came later.</p>

<p class='c017'>Sometimes on the blazing December days,
when the sun would beat on the zinc roofs,
and the glare be reflected from the white
stones and the mullock heaps, and when
there was no shade to be got under the
straight lank gum-trees, and the miners, red
and grimy and perspiring, would loaf about
the street, and the bars would be filled with
the sound of swearing, I used to fancy that,
if you wanted to find an earthly similitude
of Hades, you couldn’t go to a more likely
place than Eungella Diggings.</p>

<p class='c017'>There were drink cases, too—plenty of
them, only Nick drew the line there. Though
he humoured Nan’s pride and independent
spirit, he watched her as carefully as Dummy,
the dog, had done in days gone by.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was to last only a few months—this
probation and testing of each other.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
<img src='images/i175.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Miners, red and grimy and perspiring, would loaf about the street.” (<i>Page <a href='#Page_174'>174</a></i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Nick made a bargain for a certain date,
though he was always begging her to change
her mind, and let him off a month or so,
more especially as the nuggets thickened.</p>

<p class='c017'>And when he pleaded in his earnestness,
Nan’s face, for all its wistful, resolute look,
would brighten and brighten till it seemed
to me the face of an angel, and would give
me that nasty pain at my heart once more.
But she was resolute always, and the richer Nick
became the more she held to her determination.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan used to live with the Postmaster’s
wife, who was a good sort and something
of a lady. She used to take Nan to the
entertainments, that were given at Eungella,
and there were balls and picnics and concerts,
and even a kind of theatre, for money
was so plentiful there just then, that actors
and conjurors and people of that sort were
bound to come.</p>

<p class='c017'>This was all good for <i>The Eungella Star</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>which flourished mightily, and I made quite
a feature of “social topics.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It was a short time before Christmas when
there was a big ball given at the Town Hall,
as they called the zinc building. That was the
wind up of some races, to which I went as
in duty bound, and at which Nick ran and
rode a horse, and Nan was present with the
Postmaster’s wife, and clapped Nick as he
went victoriously past the winning post.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nick could afford to keep racehorses in
these days.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was only a few days before, that he
had come into my office—we had got great
friends—I couldn’t help liking the fine, generous
fellow in spite of my love for Nan and
the soreness of my disappointment. I am
sure that Nan had told him about the whole
affair, though he never said a word to me
on the subject, and that was what made him
so nice in his ways to me.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Curran,” he said, and his whole face
was alight, “do you believe in a good fairy
coming to bring a man luck? Nan is my
good fairy—she
has brought me
luck. The gold
has been coming
up thicker and
thicker ever since
my darling
came out to
me. To-day
has come
the biggest
luck of all.
I’m a rich man, Curran—my fortune is
made.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i179.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“He went victoriously past the winning post.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I could not help quoting the old proverb,
but Nick only laughed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Unlucky in love! Looks like it, eh? Nan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and I are a living disproof of all the saws.
Ah, my Nan shall drive down the Ladies’
Mile in her carriage yet, and I shall perhaps
fulfil what has been—next to Nan—my life’s
dream!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What’s that?” I said.</p>

<p class='c017'>“To be a power, Curran—a power for good
in that terrible city—that Babylon in which
I was born. I want to do something for
the poor and the vicious; I want to help to
save such helpless, deserted children as were
Nan and I from the fate that, but for God’s
mercy, might have been Nan’s fate and mine.
I want to get into the English Parliament,
Curran; I want to plead the cause of the
friendless—to get protection for the children—justice
for the hireling.”</p>

<p class='c017'>There was a great solemnity in Nick’s
tone, and a curious prophetic look in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c017'>He had been talking it all over with Nan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>he said. They were to be married in two
months’ time, which was the limit she had
fixed, and as soon as he was in a position
to make a good start in the old country, he
would leave Australia. And he would leave
no stone unturned to clear himself of the
charge, which would, he knew, cling to him
through life, and hinder the useful career,
which he might otherwise carve out for himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>But I am getting away from the races.
It was after Nick had won his race that a
rather handsome man of a coarse, underbred
type, well dressed, and looking what the
Australians call “flash,” was brought up by
a friend of Nan’s, and introduced as Mr. Tempest.</p>

<p class='c017'>I was standing near Nan at the time.
Nick had left her to see after something
about his horse, and she was talking gaily
to a little knot of her Eungella friends, elated
at the good luck that had befallen Nick, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>looking cool and fresh and surprisingly beautiful
in her white dress which she had put
on in honour of the occasion.</p>

<p class='c017'>I had been noticing this “Mr. Tempest.”
He was a recent arrival at the diggings, and
I did not like his manner or appearance. He
was loud, boastful, and vulgar, with a veneer
of smartness—and an occasional lapse into
ways, that would have disgraced a navvy.</p>

<p class='c017'>Just now he was on his good behaviour.
He had evidently been greatly struck with
Nan, who was certainly the belle of the Stand.
He made her a very low bow and said a
few words of compliment.</p>

<p class='c017'>I saw an odd startled look come over Nan’s
face, and she looked at him closely, and
repeated his name, as if she were puzzled.
“Mr. Tempest?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Reginald Tempest—at your service,” said
he, with a kind of leer that made me inclined
to strike him.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>They began to talk, and at every word,
the man said, I saw the mystified look deepening
in Nan’s face. She seemed glad
when she spied Nick—away down the course—and
proposed to me that we should walk
and find him.</p>

<p class='c017'>Before she went, however, Tempest had
got her promise to dance several dances
with him at the ball that evening.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan was greatly agitated. “Mr. Curran,”
she said as we walked along, “that man’s
name isn’t Tempest. I wish you’d try and
find out something about him; he is either
the brother of a man I knew long ago—the
man who got Nick into terrible trouble—or
he is the man himself, and his name is Rummles.
But he has grown a beard and moustache
since then, and is changed in every
way, and I can’t be sure.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, if I knew!” she went on, excitedly.
“He, and he only, can clear Nick, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>give him the right to go about the world
without a stain.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Curran, if there’s any spark of good
feeling in him, he’d do it now—now, after
Nick and I have suffered so. And now that
Nick is rich and has a career before him,
and wants so to do good—we’d pay him,
Mr. Curran.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’d promise for Nick the half of his fortune—you
know about the big nugget—and
Nick wants me to marry him at once, and
to get away from this dreadful place, and
start a fresh life in England. But what’s
the good of his trying, with that stain always
on him? Oh, I feel that I’d almost sell
my soul to clear him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>She told me that was the reason she had
promised the dances to Tempest. She wanted
to find out if he was really Rummles. She
said he had been fond of her once, and
perhaps he would tell her the truth now.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Remembering a look in the man’s eyes,
when they had rested on Nan, I told her it
was a dangerous game, and that she had
best not encourage this Tempest, or Rummles,
whichever he might be. But she shook
her head, and her eyes had that shining
look, which Nan’s eyes always took, when
she was determined.</p>

<p class='c017'>We missed Nick somehow in that walk;
and it wasn’t for some time—not till we got
back near the stand—that we saw him coming
from it. His face was quite white, and I
could see that he was deeply moved. He
came up to Nan.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nan,” he said, hoarsely, “I’ve seen him,
I’ve recognized him—our enemy. And you’ve
been speaking to him! Nan, I forbid you
to do it. He will work us harm again, as
he did before. And he has been talking
about you—chaffing—pretending that he has
made a conquest. I won’t have it, Nan.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>I never before saw Nick angry. He was
almost angry with Nan, and when she told
him that she had promised to dance with
Rummles, forbade her sternly. But Nan
tightened her lips. She had her own design,
I knew. I wished that she would not try
to carry it out.</p>

<p class='c017'>There was a coolness, it was very evident,
between Nick and Nan that evening. The
Postmaster’s wife told me they had almost
had words on the way to the ball, because
Nan wanted to do something that he wouldn’t
allow.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Postmaster’s wife was curious about
it, and there was talk in the ballroom, for
a good deal of interest attached to Nick
just now, because of his splendid find and
his rapidly increasing fortune.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan looked lovely. She had a soft colour,
and her white dress set off her beautiful eyes
and hair.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>It was quite a grand affair, the ball. You
wouldn’t expect there could be anything so
fine at a place like Eungella Diggings. The
stewards had sent blacks into the scrub, and
they had brought back branches of treefern
and bunya cones and creepers, and what
with flags and one thing and another, it was
as pretty a sight as you could fancy.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Baronet had turned out in swell
evening clothes, and so had the “Honourables”—though
nobody knew how they
had managed it, as they had only brought
their swags on their backs to the diggings.
And they had got out all their London
manners, and danced unlike the other men.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Gold Commissioner was at the ball,
too, and the Police Magistrate, and we had
all got ourselves up, as well as we could.</p>

<p class='c017'>Tempest was in regular dress clothes, with
a flower in his button-hole, and looked like
a Strand shopman, I thought.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Nan kept to her word and danced with
him, and I saw them sitting out and talking
very earnestly. But for all Nan’s bright
colour, she looked unhappy, and Nick scarcely
went near her. “It’s for Nick’s good,” she
said to me, when we were dancing together.
“Mr. Curran, I was right; it <i>is</i> Rummles,
and he has promised me—— Oh! Nick will
thank me some day.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Whatever Rummles had promised, he
didn’t seem in a hurry to keep his promise,
and tried in the meantime to get as much
as he could of Nan’s company. He was
always up at the doctor’s and the Postmaster’s,
where Nan spent most of her time,
and the consequence was that Nick went
seldom to see her.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nick began to look moody and wild;
but he was so proud that he wouldn’t go
straight to Nan and have things out. He
had got it into his head already, I could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>see, that she was being attracted to Rummles.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now was my time, and the devil did
whisper to me—I’ll own it honestly—that if
I chose to foment the mischief by working
on Nick’s suspicions, there’d be a chance
for me yet with Nan. But I didn’t yield to
the temptation.</p>

<p class='c017'>I did my best to put it away, and I even
expostulated with Nan for letting Rummles
come between her and Nick. The tears
came into her eyes as I talked to her. She
was looking very worn and white and thin.
All she said was, “It won’t last much longer,
Mr. Curran; I’ve got his promise, and Nick
will be grateful to me in the end.”</p>

<p class='c017'>That very afternoon, as I was going across
the gully from <i>The Star</i> office to one of my
claims, I came upon Rummles and Nan.
They were standing close by the passionfruit
hedge, which screened the Postmaster’s
garden, and she seemed to be pleading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>earnestly, and he was looking at her in a
mad, wicked sort of way.</p>

<p class='c017'>I crept round the hedge. I suppose it
was dishonourable, but I couldn’t help it.
I wanted to take care of Nan, and I felt by
that look on Rummles’ face, that he was up
to devilry.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You’ve got to do this for me,” I heard
him say, “and then I’ll do what you ask.
I’ll give you the proofs because I love you—yes,
I love you, Nan, and I’ve always loved
you, and I hate Nick because he has taken
you from me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, don’t say that,” she cried. “You
mustn’t say that. I love none but Nick,
and you mustn’t say you’re doing it for love
of me. You are doing it for love of right
and justice.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Very well,” he said with a malign laugh,
“I’m doing it for the love of right and justice.
But I’m not going to abate my terms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Nan. You are to come yourself, and alone.”</p>

<p class='c017'>She was frightened, and argued with him,
and begged him to let her bring Nick, but
he roughly refused.</p>

<p class='c017'>She had to come alone—to his hut up
the gully—after dusk that evening, and he
pledged himself to give her the proof of
Nick’s innocence. Then they parted, and I
went on to the claim, a good deal disturbed
in my mind.</p>

<p class='c017'>I was afraid, that if I told Nick, there
would be murder done, but I was determined
Nan should not go to that villain’s hut,
without my being somewhere within earshot.</p>

<p class='c017'>I skulked about the Postmaster’s house till
after sunset, and it was almost dark when I
saw Nan come out, looking very pale and
very frightened, but with the steadfast, resolute
look in her face, that I knew meant she
wasn’t to be turned from her purpose. I
felt easier about things when I saw her stop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and take a little pistol from her belt, look at
it, and hide it away again under her jacket.
Nan was a brave woman, but she was not
blindly foolhardy.</p>

<p class='c017'>I followed her to Rummles’ hut. I knew
he had a mate, and he was by way of
working hard, but I felt pretty sure he would
have got rid of his mate that evening, and
it turned out that he had.</p>

<p class='c017'>He met Nan outside his hut, and he tried
to make her go in, but she refused. She was
very quiet and gentle, and she talked to him, as
she might have done if she had been his sister.</p>

<p class='c017'>He must have had a bad heart, indeed,
not to be touched by the way she begged
him, to be true to anything that was good
in him, and to turn over a new leaf, and
lead a worthy life. And then she promised
him that she would always be his friend, and
that she and Nick would do everything in
their power to help him.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>He listened to her for a bit, and then,
when she begged him to give her the proofs
he had promised her, he came closer to her,
and broke out into a wild declaration of love;
he told her he couldn’t live without her,
abused Nick, and implored her to throw Nick
over and run away with him.</p>

<p class='c017'>I don’t know what idea he had in his mind
about carrying her off.</p>

<p class='c017'>Anyhow, he wasn’t given the chance of
trying the experiment. Directly his arm went
out to draw Nan to him, there was a dash
and a scuffle, and before I could fling myself
forward, as I had been about to do on Nan’s
behalf, I saw that another man had darted
from the shadow of the hut, on the opposite
side to where I had hidden myself, and that
it was Nick who was wrestling with his enemy,
and who finally flung him to the ground.</p>

<p class='c017'>The fellow lay half stunned; his head had
struck against the post, which supported the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>bough-shade of the hut, and when I stooped
over him, I saw that blood was streaming
from his mouth and nose.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ve knocked one of his teeth out,” said
Nick savagely. “Oh, Nan, Nan, my darling,
how could you make me so anxious and
miserable?”</p>

<p class='c017'>They were in each other’s arms, the two
completely reconciled. And Nan begged Nick
to forgive her, and then they saw me and
there was an explanation, and a half hysterical
laughing and crying on Nan’s part.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nick gripped my hand. “God bless you,
Curran,” he said. He told me how he, too,
had been hanging round the Postmaster’s
house trying to make up his mind to go in.</p>

<p class='c017'>And at first, in the dusk, he had fancied
I was Rummles, and when he had seen Nan
come out and me follow her, he had followed
us both with rage and jealousy tearing at
his heart, till, when he had reached the hut,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>and Rummles appeared, he had found out
his mistake.</p>

<p class='c017'>Rummles groaned at his pain, and Nick
told me to stay and look after him, and took
Nan’s hand to lead her away.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nan, however, clung to the idea of the
proofs of Nick’s innocence, which Rummles
had promised her, and would not leave till
Nick showed her, that there could be no
proof except Rummles’ own full confession,
and that he had been fooling her all the time.</p>

<p class='c017'>This episode brought things to a crisis
between Nan and Nick. Nan was so remorseful
for the suffering she had caused Nick
that she was ready to agree to anything he
wished. And the whole thing had shaken
her nerves, and she longed to get away from
Eungella.</p>

<p class='c017'>As for Nick, he had an almost superstitious
dread of Rummles, whom he looked
upon as his evil genius, and was firmly convinced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>that, if they all three remained at the
Diggings, Rummles would in the end accomplish
his evil purpose of separating him from
Nan. And so, saying no word to anyone
at first, he quietly made his arrangements for
departure.</p>

<p class='c017'>On Christmas Eve the downward steamer
would touch at the seaport for Eungella—a
half day’s coach journey from the Diggings.
And on the morning of Christmas Eve Nick
was married to Nan.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nick had got a special licence, and the
wedding took place very early in the morning,
and had but few spectators.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>
<img src='images/i197.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“On the morning of Christmas Eve Nick was married to Nan.” (<i>Page <a href='#Page_196'>196</a></i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The day was tropical in its heat, but a
faint breeze crept up the gully, and there
were some misty clouds in the bright blue
sky. The grapes were ripening in the Chinamen’s
gardens on the gully slope, and we
gathered some jasmine flowers for Nan to
wear. Strange irony of fate—to use the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>penny-a-liner phrase—it was I who gave Nan
to her husband.</p>

<p class='c017'>I went with them to the seaport, and waited
with them till the steamer came in.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was just such a night as this, and the
Southern Cross was shining as brightly as it
shines on me to-night. And in a garden
by the wharf there was a tree of great
ghostly strong-scented trumpet flowers.</p>

<p class='c017'>As I stood on the wharf and watched the
steamer going out to sea, taking Nan out
of my life for ever, the clock struck, and I
knew it was Christmas Day. And it seemed
a mockery of my sorrow, when the voices
of the children came down to me, from the
road above, singing the old carol of frosty
nights and ice-bound roads and clear glistening
Northern constellations, singing here,
under these tropical skies and strange stars,
and in the murmurous night laden with rich
sickly perfume—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“God bless you, merry gentlemen,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Let nothing you dismay,</div>
      <div class='line'>For Jesus Christ our Saviour</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Was born this Christmas Day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>And Nan was gone!</p>
<p class='c017'>I went back to Eungella and duly chronicled
the wedding and the departure of the
bride and bridegroom in <i>The Star</i>. And I
wrote a leader on Nick’s sudden gain of
fortune, and on the finding of big nuggets
in general, and I made Nick the text for a
sermon on pluck and perseverance and fidelity.</p>

<p class='c017'>But I didn’t write anything about my own
aching heart.</p>

<p class='c017'>I was in <i>The Star</i> office reading over the
slips of proof, one night not long after, when
a digger I knew came in. He was one of
the “Honourables,” and he and I were
rather chums.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There’s some ‘copy’ for you down at
Ruffey’s,” he said.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Ruffey’s was the big public-house of the
place.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I couldn’t stand it. This devil’s hole has
finished me. I am going to clear out of it
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What’s the row?” I asked carelessly.
Rows were common enough at Eungella, and
knife scratches too.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, a regular ‘go-as-you-like-it’ fight,” he
said. “A digger called Voucher—you know
him, next claim to mine—and another fellow,
a good-looking counter-jumper sort of fellow.</p>

<p class='c017'>“They brought some tools in to sharpen,
and they went drinking, and the end was a
flourish of the tomahawk, Voucher was sharpening.
Voucher hit the other chap on the head
with the edge and rubbed it in with the flat.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I made for the tomahawk and collared
it after a scuffle, but not before the other
chap had pulled out a knife. That was
the signal for Voucher’s bowie knife, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>other fellow got a nasty wound. I came off
for a doctor, and I’ve sent him along to
Ruffey’s, and now I shall go and turn in.”</p>

<p class='c017'>One used to get callous to that sort of
thing at Eungella. But it was “copy” for
me. I prepared for a move to the scene
of the fight.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Who is the man, who has been stabbed?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The chap that was after that girl you
saw married the other day—Sister Nan. He
is not a friend of yours, is he? If he is, I
am sorry for you. But you needn’t be uneasy.
He’ll get over his scratch right enough.
They all do, worse luck.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, he is not a friend of mine,” I
answered. And I did not wait for another
word. An idea had taken possession of me.
It seemed to me a call of fate. I took up
my hat and rushed to Ruffey’s.</p>

<p class='c017'>The bar had a curiously quiet look. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>men who were in it seemed awed, I thought.</p>

<p class='c017'>There was a policeman hanging about,
and policemen were not common at Eungella,
and generally kept out of the way
when there was a row.</p>

<p class='c017'>I pushed my way into the inner parlour.
A crowd of people were collected there, and
I saw the doctor bending over a stretcher
covered with a red blanket, on which lay
the wounded man. The man was Rummles.</p>

<p class='c017'>I asked the doctor what he thought of
the case. “It’s a bad business,” he answered.
“They have sent for the Police Magistrate.
He says he wants to make a deposition, and
he had better make haste.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Rummles looked up and saw me. “You’ll
do,” he said, in a broken, hoarse voice.
“I’m done for, and I’d best make what
amends I can. I’m doing it for her; not
for justice, mind you, but for her—for Nan.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The Police Magistrate and the clergyman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>came in just then. The doctor cleared a
space round the dying man, and he made
his last confession.</p>

<p class='c017'>He confessed that it was he, who had
stolen the watch and had placed it in Nick’s
pocket, and allowed Nick to be punished
for the theft.</p>

<p class='c017'>The deposition was read out to him, and,
with an effort, he signed his name. “She’s
brought me bad luck,” were his last words.
“I’ve never had any luck since I took that
watch. I’ve never had any luck, since I fell
in love with Nan. And just as I was beginning
to get on, she came back, and
here’s the worst luck of all. But I’d like
her to know that I loved her, and that it’s
done—for Nan.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_7 c016'>I&nbsp;HAVE found, in the course
of a pretty long acquaintance
with men and things,
that the House of Commons
is one of the few
places of which one is
never weary.</p>

<p class='c017'>I am speaking for myself,
of course. I know there
are other men, who think
differently from me, who
regard the House of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Commons with disdain, if not with positive
dislike, and the men, I have at this moment
in my mind, are not men who affect a contempt
for the unattainable thing, but men
who have been in the House of Commons
and who could be there again, if they wished.</p>

<p class='c017'>But, for my own part, I candidly confess
that I am unable to understand their state
of mind on the matter.</p>

<p class='c017'>To me the House of Commons is always
a delightful place. I offer it the uncompromising
admiration that young poets lay at the
feet of their mistresses; I feel for it the
affection that a friend feels for a friend. But
I do not wish it to be supposed, because I
say all this, that I am convinced that I have
in me the makings of a great statesman, or,
indeed, that my presence at Westminster is
in any serious degree indispensable to the
safety of the commonweal.</p>

<p class='c017'>I like, of course, to think that, when I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>have given a vote, I have given it as an
honest man for the side which I think to
be in the right.</p>

<p class='c017'>I like, of course, to think that, when I
make my little speech—and I confess that I
address the House not infrequently, and the
House is good enough to hear me with
patience—that I am doing what lies in me
to advance the general good. But my interest
in the House of Commons does not
come in the first instance from philanthropy
or a zeal for the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c017'>I like the House of Commons as other
men like a theatre, as other men like to
travel. I like the theatre, too, and I like to
travel; but I would rather have the House
of Commons, than any theatre that ever was
built, and would rather walk through the
lobbies, than wander over Europe.</p>

<p class='c017'>What play was ever so keenly exciting as
a heavy debate at Westminster; what travels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>bring one more into touch with all varieties
of men than long experience of the ways of
Westminster? None, none, none.</p>

<p class='c017'>The House of Commons is like the <i>Eau
de Jouvence</i>; it makes old men young again,
and revives, in the hearts of respectable elderly
gentlemen, the feverish pulses of youth.</p>

<p class='c017'>The excitement, which leads a noble lord to
leap upon the benches and halloo for joy
over a Ministerial defeat, is as keen as any
which moves the pulses of boyhood in the
cricket field or the pulses of manhood in
battle or exploration. So the House of Commons
is to me as the great theatre of life,
and I find unending pleasures in its acts and
its actors.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have seen some pretty stirring scenes,
too, in my time. I have been in the House
of Commons now for nearly twenty years,
and, in that time, I have been present at
almost every event of any note, that has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>animated its precincts and inspired its orators.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have had my share of all-night sittings;
have seen men stand at the bar of the House;
have watched the rise and ruin of reputations;
have seen Ministry after Ministry reel
to its fall.</p>

<p class='c017'>But I honestly think that I have never seen
a more remarkable scene, than the one to
which you have referred, and about which
you have asked me, as an eye-witness, to
give you some few particulars.</p>

<p class='c017'>I saw Mr. John Drury on the day when
he entered the House of Commons, and I
remember very well how struck I was by
his commanding presence and singularly
beautiful face.</p>

<p class='c017'>I use the word “beautiful” advisedly. It
is a word we reserve mostly nowadays for
the faces of women; but John Drury’s face
impressed me immediately with a sense of
its beauty—its strong, calm, honourable beauty.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>All I knew of him was, that he came from
the colonies; that he was reputed to be
wealthy, even very wealthy; and that he had
come into the House of Commons at a by-election,
as the advocate of views, which he
had championed with great success in the
columns of the London daily paper, <i>The Planet</i>,
which he himself owned and had founded.</p>

<p class='c017'>That was all I knew then. There was,
however, much more to know, and I learned
it later in a sufficiently remarkable manner.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was a winter session, I remember. Fond
as I am of the House of Commons I have
no great passion for winter sessions.</p>

<p class='c017'>My affection for the House is a legitimate,
not an abnormal affection, and I like it to
pursue its orderly course.</p>

<p class='c017'>London is not pleasant in winter, while
Cairo is; and, as a general rule, I would
rather spend my Christmas on the Nile than
by the Thames. But I would not have missed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>seeing the event, which I am about to
tell you, even to have been at Luxor a few
weeks earlier, for I got off to Egypt immediately
after the House rose, thank goodness!</p>

<p class='c017'>That winter session was unavoidable. There
were things to do, which ought to have been
done before, and which had to be done then,
on the “better late than never” principle. We
were really not very far off from Christmas
Eve, when the event took place, which compensated
me at least for the grey city and
the weary winter days and the belated Commons.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Drury had proved himself to be a
force in English public life, before he entered
the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c017'>His newspaper, <i>The Planet</i>, had made
itself the outspoken mouthpiece of all the
interests of the labouring classes and of the
poor, and he himself had earned a very
considerable reputation, as a public speaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>at more than one platform in the mining and
agricultural regions of England.</p>

<p class='c017'>Naturally, when a man attains to any
degree of eminence in England, his fellow
citizens want to know all about him. Demand
creates a supply, and the Society papers
afforded the world at large the opportunity
of learning a number of facts about the past
life of Mr. Drury.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was soon well known that he had made
his fortune at the gold-fields.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was well known, also, that when he
went to the gold-fields he went as a pardoned
felon, as a convict, who had been set at
liberty on account of his gallant conduct in
saving a warder’s life, during a mutiny of
his fellow prisoners on board the transport ship.</p>

<p class='c017'>It would be idle to deny that at first the
stories which got into circulation raised a
kind of prejudice against Mr. Drury.</p>

<p class='c017'>Of course the wrong version of any story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>always gets the greatest hearing, and, as the
particular line which Mr. Drury took up in
politics was not calculated to make him
extremely popular with the easy-going and
with the well-to-do, the wrong story obtained
a very considerable amount of credence.</p>

<p class='c017'>But it was an entirely wrong story, and
its wrongfulness was made plain soon enough,
even to the most obstinate intelligence. For
Mr. Drury took the bull by the horns at once.</p>

<p class='c017'>He published in <i>The Planet</i> the whole of
the proceedings connected with his trial; he
repeated with the most admirable firmness
and coolness his own denial of the crime,
and he concluded his defence very triumphantly
by producing the written confession
of the real thief—a man named Rummles,
I believe—who died in a drunken brawl at
Eungella Diggings, a confession duly attested
by the police magistrate, the clergyman, and
Mr. Alfred Curran, who has since become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>conspicuous in Colonial politics as the editor of
Mr. Drury’s Australian paper, <i>The Southern Cross</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>Of course, this confession silenced everybody,
or nearly everybody.</p>

<p class='c017'>Unhappily, there is a class of politician,
a small class I am glad to believe, who will
stick at nothing to harm an antagonist, and
this small class, like all other classes, does
occasionally find its representative in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Drury had not been long in the
House of Commons before he began to make a
name there, as he had already made a name in
journalism. It does not take long nowadays
for a man to make his mark at St. Stephen’s.</p>

<p class='c017'>In old days, before my time, and even in
my time, it was a slow business for a man
to take his right place in the House. It
was a kind of unwritten law that a man
should not speak at all till he had been in
the House for at least a session, and very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>scrupulous or very old-fashioned persons carried
the period of probation to a further
degree still. But we have changed all that,
as <i>Sganarelle</i> says in Molière’s play.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have heard a new member make his
maiden speech on the very night, on which
he entered the House for the first time, and
within a few hours of the ceremony of taking
the oath.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Drury was not like that, indeed; but
neither did he belong to the old-fashioned
school of politicians. He waited a decorous
week before speaking, and when he spoke
for the first time, he spoke exceedingly well,
with a modest dignity which pleased all his
hearers—or almost all his hearers—and which
won him at once a promising place amongst
the “young men.”</p>

<p class='c017'>I shall not forget that night, less because
of Drury’s first speech, good though it was,
and glad though I always am to hear a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>good speech, than for another reason. If I
remember rightly, it is Goethe who says
somewhere, that one should never pass a day
without reading a beautiful poem or looking
upon the face of a beautiful woman.</p>

<p class='c017'>Certainly the day in which one does look
upon a beautiful woman, is better than days
less blessed, and I am always glad and grateful
for the privilege of seeing a beautiful woman.
And I saw a very beautiful woman that night.</p>

<p class='c017'>I had gone up into the Ladies’ Gallery to
look after the wife and daughter of a constituent,
whom I had been lucky enough to
get places for, when I saw in the gallery a
woman’s face, such a glorious face. In its
divine, dark beauty it conquered my attention,
my admiration. I forgot manners, and stared—simply
stared.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>
<img src='images/i217.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>In the Ladies’ Gallery.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I don’t think she noticed me at all. She
seemed to be entirely occupied by looking
steadfastly at someone who was seated in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Chamber below. Whoever he was, I envied
him to have earned the homage of those
glorious, midnight eyes.</p>

<p class='c017'>As I was leaving the gallery, I asked
Wilson, the doorkeeper, who the lady was,
the dark, handsome lady in the front row of
the gallery. Wilson glanced in the direction
I indicated, and answered me directly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“That, sir,” he said, “is Mrs. John Drury.”</p>

<p class='c017'>As I went down the stairs, to get to the
corridor which leads to the Chamber, I could
not help reflecting upon the generous way
in which destiny seemed to have made
amends to John Drury. Still young, very
rich, a famous journalist, a rising politician,
and, above all, blessed with a wife of such
extraordinary beauty.</p>

<p class='c017'>“John Drury,” I said to myself, “you are
a lucky man, and I hope and believe that
you deserve it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>But the event, which I know you want particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>to hear about, took place some little
time after that—a couple of weeks later if I
remember rightly.</p>

<p class='c017'>There were some friends dining with me
that night; there were ladies in the party,
and I had got one of the pleasantest tables
in the ladies’ dining-room for my little group.</p>

<p class='c017'>It chanced that John Drury and his wife
were dining at the next table, and if I had
thought her beautiful before in the dim light of
the Ladies’ Gallery, I thought her still more radiantly
fair in the bright light of the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c017'>I guessed from her presence that Drury
was about to speak; it was an important
debate on some question of the hours of
labour, and by this time everyone “in the
know” was not willing to miss a chance of
hearing John Drury.</p>

<p class='c017'>So, when our dinner was over, I bundled
my little party upstairs, saw the ladies into
their gallery, succeeded in wedging the men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>in “Under the Clock,” and got back to my
own seat, as soon as I could.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was very lucky I did so, for I heard
a fine speech, which I had expected and
hoped for, and witnessed a scene which I
had neither expected nor hoped for.</p>

<p class='c017'>John Drury made his speech, and a very
able speech it was, spoken with a Saxon
simplicity and straightforwardness, which
reminded me a little of Bright, but enriched
with an amount of illustration, which showed
a far wider reading than Bright’s.</p>

<p class='c017'>In its way I don’t think I ever heard a
better speech. I daresay I didn’t agree with
all his arguments—that didn’t matter at all;
it was a real pleasure to listen to such a
speech. Its very defect, in being too eloquent
for the modern conversational standard debate
in the House of Commons, gave it a freshness
and a charm of its own.</p>

<p class='c017'>Drury, too, had one great secret—he never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>wearied his audience. He never uttered
a sentence, never uttered a syllable too
much. He said all that he wanted to say,
fully and finely, and then he sat down, as
he always sat down, amidst rapturous applause.</p>

<p class='c017'>On this particular evening he spoke at his
best; and when he sat down the applause,
on his side, was loud and long. While it lasted,
I glanced up at the gilded bars, which hide the
occupants of the Ladies’ Gallery, and thought
of that dark, beautiful face which watched its
lover’s triumph, of the glorious dark eyes that
widened with delight at their lover’s success.</p>

<p class='c017'>By the time that I had sighed the little
sigh of envy, which one pays as a tribute
to the happy possessor of youth and beauty,
the applause, which had rung out for Drury’s
eloquent championship of the poor, had died
away, and I noticed that a pert young member
of the Government had jumped to his feet
to answer him.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>
<img src='images/i223.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“On this particular evening he spoke at his best.” (<i>Page <a href='#Page_222'>222</a></i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>As an answer it was ridiculous enough,
about as valuable a contribution, to the
question in hand, as the suggestion of the
luckless queen, that, if the poor people had
no bread to eat, they might eat cakes instead.
But it had one significant passage.</p>

<p class='c017'>The young fellow, flushed and excited by
his own pertness, lost his head and with it
his manners.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The honourable gentleman,” he said,
pointing offensively in the direction, where
John Drury sat quietly listening to him;
“the honourable gentleman has made an
eloquent appeal for the idle, for the improvident,
for all who go to make up what are
rightly called the dangerous classes. Well,
Sir, in this House we go in for the representation
of minorities, and though I am
thankful to think that the dangerous classes
are in the minority in this country, it is, no
doubt, according to the latest political lights,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>fit and proper that they, too, should find
their representative in this House.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The speaker had got thus far, when several
of the men on our side of the House began
to interrupt with cries of “Oh, oh,” which
were somewhat hotly responded to, by cheers
from some of the men in the immediate
vicinity of the speaker. Goaded by the
hostility and the applause, the speaker flung
out one last defiant, insolent sentence.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, Sir, the dangerous classes must
have their representative in this House, and
where could they, by any possibility, find a
better representative than a convicted felon——”</p>

<p class='c017'>He was not allowed to finish the sentence.
The hubbub that arose of angry groans and
defiant cheers—for I am sorry to say that
the foolish young gentleman had his backers—drowned
the rest of his sentence, and he
sat down amidst a display of the stormiest
excitement on both sides of the House.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>
<img src='images/i227.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>The noble Lord.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>I have seen bad and bitter scenes in
St. Stephen’s, but never a worse, never a
bitterer scene than on that night. Men who,
I know, in their hearts did not associate the
name of John Drury with any stain, took
sides with his assailant and cheered vociferously
for the savage attack that had just
been made upon him.</p>

<p class='c017'>Drury’s speech had been a severe arraignment
of the Government, and the Ministerialists
were sore and angry, and they took
their revenge unchivalrously, as even civilized
men will still occasionally do.</p>

<p class='c017'>I dare not say how many seconds the
groaning and the cheering lasted, groaning
and cheering through which, at intervals, the
Speaker’s stern voice was heard calling
persistently for order.</p>

<p class='c017'>But at last it did die down, and when it
had died down, half a dozen men on each
side were found standing on their legs, eager
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>to catch the Speaker’s eye. But when it was
found that John Drury had risen with the
rest, the others sat down, and he remained
standing, very pale, very quiet, very determined,
facing his antagonists, who greeted
him with cries of “Spoke, spoke, spoke.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wish, Mr. Speaker,” said John Drury,
“to make a personal explanation,” and as
he uttered those words all of us, who sat
near him, caught up the phrase, and
shouted “personal explanation” as loudly
and as long as we could.</p>

<p class='c017'>Amidst the tumult the Speaker rose from
his chair, and John Drury immediately sat
down. The tumult subsided, as it always
does when the Speaker asserts his authority.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Does the honourable member,” the
Speaker asked, glancing in the direction where
John Drury sat, “wish to make a personal
explanation to the House?”</p>

<p class='c017'>John Drury raised his hat, the Speaker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>sat down, gathering the folds of his black
robe about him, and John Drury rose to his
feet, this time in perfect silence. I glanced
up to the Gallery, and saw, or thought I
saw, a pale, lovely face, and two enchanting
eyes.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I rise, Sir,” said John Drury, speaking
very calmly and slowly, “to utter, with your
permission, and with the permission of this
House, which is always generous to an
attacked man, a few, a very few, words of
personal explanation.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here almost everyone, even on the Ministerial
side, applauded, for, to do the House
justice, it is generally willing to give a man
a chance to defend himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The right honourable gentleman, who
has just sat down,” John Drury went on,
“has accused me of being a convicted felon.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here a few cheers came from the neighbourhood
of the Drury assailant, but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>were not convincing cheers, and they were
hushed down by a storm of disapproval on
our side.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am in my right,” Drury went on, “in
immediately taking notice of that accusation.
Mr. Speaker, the right honourable gentleman
is unjust, when he makes that accusation. I
can only hope, for the sake of his own
honour, that he is not wilfully unjust. When
he calls me a convicted felon, he utters, and
he knows he utters, words which are false
words, words which frame a lie.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here the storm broke out afresh, but it
was silenced by the Speaker’s stern call for
order, and Drury went on composedly with
his defence.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I was, it is true, convicted; I never was
a felon. I was convicted, as anyone may
learn who cares to take the trouble to read
what I have published concerning this matter,
on false evidence; I was betrayed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>treachery of a friend, of a man who on his
death-bed confessed to the crime of which
he had been guilty, a confession duly attested
by unimpeachable witnesses.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I stand here to-night with a conscience as
clean as that of any member of this House,
a conscience, I may venture to say, that is
cleaner than that of the man who has wantonly,
if not maliciously, accused me of what he
may know, or ought to know, is not true.
And, Sir, if I cannot within the scope of a
life filled with many hardships, many temptations,
and few successes, hope to fulfil the
motto, ‘Vivit post funera Virtus,’ which, as
I only too well remember, was the motto
on the watch, which I was supposed to have
stolen, and for the theft of which I was
sentenced to transportation, still, Sir, I can
cast back denial in the teeth of the right
honourable member, from whose lips the
charge has come, and to him I say in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>presence of this honourable assembly that I
can claim to stand amongst you, shoulder
to shoulder, as an honest man.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Drury sat down amidst renewed excitement;
the cheers on our side were simply
deafening, and I am glad to say that they
were accompanied by hearty cheers from the
other side.</p>

<p class='c017'>Before they were quite silenced Drury’s
assailant had the grace to get up and express
his regret for what he had, in the heat of
an unguarded moment, allowed himself to say.</p>

<p class='c017'>So in the phrase familiar to the reports
of foreign assemblies, “the incident then
closed,” as far as the outer public was
concerned. What I have told you, you will
find in Hansard, if you choose to look for it.</p>

<p class='c017'>What happened immediately afterwards,
you will not find in Hansard.</p>

<p class='c017'>After Drury’s antagonist had apologized,
Drury rose and left the House. As he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>so, one of the occupants of the Treasury
Bench, my excellent friend Barkston, who
was a member of the Cabinet, followed his
example. A few minutes later I left the
House myself, with my thoughts turned in
the direction of the Ladies’ Gallery. In the
long corridor, that runs parallel with the
Library, I found two men in deep colloquy.
They were John Drury and Samuel Barkston.</p>

<p class='c017'>What Barkston told me himself a little
later—we were old friends, Barkston and
I—would seem incredible if it were not
actually true.</p>

<p class='c017'>In John Drury, Barkston had actually
discovered his long-lost son. Perhaps I ought
not to use the phrase “long-lost,” for Barkston
only learned that night, that he ever
had a son. But that John Drury was his
son there was no doubt whatever. And the
curious thing was, that Barkston was led to
make this extraordinary discovery entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>through John Drury’s speech of that evening.</p>

<p class='c017'>For when John Drury, in his concluding
sentences, quoted the Latin words upon the
watch, that he had been accused of stealing,
Mr. Barkston started as if he had been struck.</p>

<p class='c017'>For the motto on the watch was his own
motto, the motto which, as he remembered,
had been engraved upon the watch, that he
had lost.</p>

<p class='c017'>This it was that led him, as I say, to
follow John Drury from the Chamber, and
to begin that conversation with him, which
I had witnessed in the Library Lobby.</p>

<p class='c017'>In this conversation, bit by bit, Mr. Barkston
learned enough to convince him—and
subsequent inquiries absolutely confirmed the
conviction—that John Drury, the brilliant
journalist, one of the most conspicuous of
the coming men, was in very fact his own child.</p>

<p class='c017'>When Barkston was a young man, he fell
in love with a beautiful actress in a burlesque
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>theatre, and, being a rash young man, he
married her privately.</p>

<p class='c017'>The woman was light-hearted and light-headed
to an astonishing degree, and at a
time, when it seemed probable that she was
likely to become a mother, she actually left
Barkston in the company of an actor, in the
company to which she belonged.</p>

<p class='c017'>Barkston tried without success to trace
her, but it seemed, after long inquiries, he
ascertained that she gave birth to a boy,
that her lover objected to the encumbrance
of the child, and that the unhappy mother
abandoned it. She was herself afterwards
abandoned by her lover, and died, it would
seem, wretchedly.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is a sad little story, my dear friend,
and has in it, perhaps, the pith of a sermon
against vice, which some better fellow than
I might preach with advantage to his hearers.</p>

<p class='c017'>I am not a preacher, I am only a humble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>looker-on at the grim game of life, with its
joys and its sorrow, its dances and its dirges,
and if I find a lot that is sad in it, I find
a lot that is bright and brave as well.</p>

<p class='c017'>Anyhow, I think old Barkston is to be
envied. It is pleasant to be rich and to be
a Cabinet Minister, but it is more pleasant
to be the father of a man like John Drury.</p>

<p class='c017'>Let me add that I think it is still more
pleasant to be the father-in-law of a woman
like John Drury’s wife.</p>

<p class='c017'>I have often had the pleasure of meeting
her since, and I can honestly say, that I
think she is as clever as she is beautiful,
and as good as she is clever. From which

kept to the name by which he had won his
way to success—is a happy man.</p>

<p class='c016'>I <span class='small'>HAVE</span> often heard it said, that a drowning
man, before he sinks, never to rise again in
this world, sees mirrored instantly in the
dreamy mist, the dramatic moments and
episodes of his life.</p>
<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>I can well believe it. Your hard-fisted
sour-minded Puritan will tell you, that he
only sees written in letters of blood the
sins he has committed, the hearts he has
broken, and the things which he has left
undone.</p>

<p class='c017'>A more beautiful belief in an all-merciful
Providence persuades me, that something of
the music and the melody of his life is not
forgotten even then, and that, if there be
such music and melody, even in the lives
of the worst of us, they are allowed mercifully
to alleviate the agonies of our last
moments, to help us through the darkness
of that interminable valley which lives in the
future for all of us, and whose end no one
knows.</p>

<p class='c017'>I felt exactly in the position of that typical
drowning man, when I walked alone—as I
shall ever walk alone whilst life lasts—between
North Repps Cottage and my house at The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Highlands, in the village of Syderstrand in
Norfolk, one memorable Christmas Eve.</p>

<p class='c017'>It is not a long walk, as you all know,
within shelter of wood and sound of everlasting
sea.</p>

<p class='c017'>A ruined church, lovingly mantled in dark
ivy; a fisher village modernized out of all
recognition; two or three scattered farms,
sturdy and flinty and grim, laughing to scorn
the modern gimcrack red houses that offend
the landscape—this is all I passed, from the
moment the hospitable door closed behind
me, and I had said a “Good night, God
bless you” to the old Cheevers who went
up the hill to their pretty home in the
North Repps almshouses.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Christmas Eve was over. I had
pressed the hand of my old friend and patron,
Samuel Barkston, now the owner of North
Repps Hall, who was sleeping that Christmas
Eve under the roof of North Repps Cottage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>now the house of dear old Nick and ever
beautiful Nan, and I had made an appointment
for all of them on the morrow after
Christmas service to “take pot-luck” with the
lonely old parson, happy and contented in
the care of the simple souls, who dwell in
the seaside cottages of Overstrand and its
sister parish Syderstrand.</p>

<p class='c017'>What were the unexpected words that rang
in my ears that Christmas Eve, when I had
toasted them all, a glass of excellently brewed
punch in my hand, in the simple phrase,
“God bless us all”? It came from the pipy,
crooning voice of old Cheevers, who spoke
with his good old wife’s hand locked in his
own, and thus he spoke:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, this ’ere is wonderful! wery wonderful,
my dear.”</p>

<p class='c017'>And then Mrs. Cheevers gave a little convulsive
sob, and shed another tear.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Only to think of our little Nick and Nan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>and me and you standing ’ere and drinking their
’earty good ’ealth, and the ’ealth of them
dear little ones, and a wishing of ’em ‘A
Merry Christmas,’ which we does with all
our ’eart, and God’s blessing.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This is what I heard, with my very own
ears, before the hospitable door closed behind
me, and I turned my back on the lights and
glowing Christmas fire, and walked out among
the snow-covered rhododendrons, a lonely
and neglected clergyman.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was then that, under the starry heavens,
the keen wind whistling about my ears, the
boughs of the leafless trees shrieking, as if
they were in pain, and the sea moaning its
eternal dull chant in the distance, that my
life was mirrored before me, as it must and
ever shall be, until time ends, to the drowning
or the dying man.</p>

<p class='c017'>All my days at Oxford, their wild hopes
and ambitions, all my trials of athleticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and strength, in the old days when port and
sherry wine at the University were thought
more of than any Olympian games.</p>

<p class='c017'>Flash! flash! flash! went the memories
across my brain.</p>

<p class='c017'>The day, oh! memorable day of days,
when I was stroke of the Oxford eight, and
we beat Cambridge with seven oars.</p>

<p class='c017'>The day when I won the silver sculls, and
helped to win the silver pair oars, that rest
under a glass case in my East Anglian rectory.</p>

<p class='c017'>The day when I determined, God willing,
to devote my life to the poor, and found
that a dandified Christ Church student, who
wore his long hair in a net—as they did in
those days—was changed into an East-end
curate with two daily services to attend to,
several sermons to write, and loathsome,
unventilated hovels to visit day by day.</p>

<p class='c017'>The day when I fell in love, and the day
when love’s paradise was closed to me for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>ever. That one supremely delicious moment,
in years gone by, when with tears in her
eyes she came across the room, where we
were alone together, and kissing me purely
on the forehead, looked into my eyes and
whispered “Be a friend to me!”</p>

<p class='c017'>The day—ah! <i>nefasti dies</i>—when in my
arms she breathed her last, and trying to
divide her crucifix with me, that we might
part in soul no more for ever, she whispered,
“Love, be good!” and I was alone for evermore.</p>

<p class='c017'>The day when, distracted with grief, hungry
and eager for work, I became a prison chaplain,
in order to bury my grief in comforting
others in their hour of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c017'>Flash! flash! flash! went the memories,
and still the night wind whistled through the
trees, still the great sea moaned its eternal
song under the cliffs that lead to the Garden
of Sleep.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Now I was in Australia, whither I had
wandered in my despair, standing white-robed
before the altar, where I had made
our Nick and Nan man and wife. Now
back again in England, where I fell in with
Samuel Barkston, the <i>Mascotte</i> of my strange,
wandering and lonely life.</p>

<p class='c017'>Why is it, that I look upon this good
fellow as the best friend man ever had on
earth? Has he not done everything that
one Christian man can do for another?
Has he not well deserved the love of every
one of the villagers round about, and become
part of the heart’s life of those who just now,
on this Christmas Eve, at my bidding, said
“God bless us all”?</p>

<p class='c017'>Have you ever seen the modest, picturesque
almshouses, that dear old Barkston built
in the village of North Repps, near Cromer?
Have you never passed them in warm midsummer
covered with roses, embraced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>dark purple clematis, smelling of new-mown
hay, and decked round with old stocks and
golden marigold?</p>

<p class='c017'>I call it a harbour of refuge. Was it not
Samuel Barkston who, at my simple suggestion,
brought down the dear old Cheevers,
man and wife, my old world parishioners, to
exchange the dark roar and riot of London,
the dirt, the care, and unrest, where they
would have decayed into the workhouse, to
weather their last years out in God’s country,
in a haven of rest, built by man in God’s
eternal honour?</p>

<p class='c017'>Why do they pooh-pooh and ridicule the
men of wealth who build these harbours of
refuge for the poor? Surely they do a noble
work.</p>

<p class='c017'>What ignominy is it, to live in this peaceful
and blessed dependence? What disgrace,
to accept the hand-clasp of such beautiful
charity? I never pass one of these hospitals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>of old England, from that of St. Cross at
Winchester down to the most modern building
dedicated, “Ad majorem Dei gloriam,”
without taking off my hat and saying a
prayer for the rest of the souls of such
pious benefactors.</p>

<p class='c017'>What, indeed, has not my excellent patron
and chosen friend done, for the dear ones
who love him so well?</p>

<p class='c017'>His son mercifully restored to him, he
has placed at North Repps Cottage, one of
the ideal love nests of this beautiful old England
of ours, and there he dwells, when he
can be spared from his splendid philanthropic
labours, and from Parliament, and from
countless duties, with the beautiful, dark-eyed,
whole-souled, handsome Nan, who is
the Lady Bountiful of the villagers for miles
and miles around.</p>

<p class='c017'>And if, after their wandering life, great
sorrows and bitter trials, the cottage in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>wood seems rather a new and restricted sort
of domain after the gold-fields and mighty
distances of Australia, their children, at any
rate, have no such ideas or contrasts whatever.</p>

<p class='c017'>Here, by these primrose woods and bluebell
carpets, in this enchanted district, more than
one of the youngsters, who own Nick and Nan
as best of fathers and mothers, were born.</p>

<p class='c017'>Here they have played since infancy, under
the famous copper beeches, hedged round
in June time with rhododendron bloom, and
here their sharp ears have often heard Nick
and Nan discuss and compare the varied
beauties of England and Australia. And
though Nick would say he loved Australia
best, because there he became the lord and
master of the sweetest woman in the world,
still Nan will ever keep on insisting that
there is no place like home, after all, and
emphasize the truth of it with a kiss on her
husband’s honest face and faithful lips.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>And if Samuel Barkston has done all
these things to others, what has he not done
for me—for me, who had no claim upon
him, but that of friendship loyal and sincere?</p>

<p class='c017'>Did he not discover, in that marvellous
way that generous men discover all that we
want and secretly pray for, that this corner
of the earth was the one that I best loved?</p>

<p class='c017'>Did he not know that, from almost boyhood
I had said that if I coveted my neighbour’s
house—which was a very wrong thing
to do—it was The Highlands in the village
of Syderstrand that I alone coveted? And
why?</p>

<p class='c017'>Not only because it commands a glorious
view of sea and pasture; not only that the
blue of the sky is continued in the sea, or
that the gold of the sun is repeated in the
corn; not only that the air, we breathe here,
is life and the atmosphere exhilaration; not
only that here the wicked seem to cease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>from troubling and that the weary are at
rest; not only that the villagers hereabouts
seem the kindliest people in the world, thankful
for every gentle act of thought and proof
of sympathy; not only that I have lived the
greatest part of my life amidst these associations—but
there was another reason that
influenced my friend in his greatest act of
kindness.</p>

<p class='c017'>Under the chancel wall of the little village
church of Syderstrand, hidden from the road,
in full sight of the sea and the poppy-covered
corn, you may have observed a simple
white marble cross.</p>

<p class='c017'>There, in everlasting peace, rests the only
woman who ever had any influence on my
life. We met and loved within a few yards
of the spot where I left her for ever, by the
sea that was her delight and the fields that
were the scene of our daily wanderings.</p>

<p class='c017'>What a gift from man to man! To be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>presented with the care of these faithful
souls; to preach to them, to pray for them,
to visit them in their sickness, to advise
them in their sorrows, to hear their heartfelt
blessings when my feet cross their threshold;
to love our fellow-creatures and to be loved
again; to feel one has found a mission upon
earth; to exchange the cares of a long and
restless life for one of profound peace; to
be able to retire to rest every night in true
thankfulness of heart; and to be the appointed
guardian of the grave of a woman, one
has loved with surpassing love—these have
been the gifts showered undeservedly on the
head of the lonely clergyman who, strange
to say, has all his life long been hovering
about the homes and the destinies of nearly
all the actors in this strange and eventful
drama.</p>

<p class='c017'>But, as I think over these last fifty years
of a tolerably restless life, the strangest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>circumstance of all is this—that I have been
made to-day a kind of Peacemaker, and a
witness on the most eventful Christmas Eve
of my life of what may be called “Good
will towards men.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It was quite half a century ago, when I
came across good, honest, kind-hearted Mr.
and Mrs. Cheevers, who, as you know, were
so intimately connected with the baby lives
of poor neglected Nick and Nan. I came
up from Oxford to my parochial work in
the East-end of London, fired with enthusiasm,
and settled down determined to do my best
for the poor, who were not so well looked
after, in those days, as they are now. My
first curacy was in the New North-road,
Hoxton—the long, new thoroughfare, that
led in a pretty straight line from the heart
of the City to the green and delightful suburbs
of Highbury and Canonbury.</p>

<p class='c017'>But what a difference between the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>London of those days and the new London
of to-day! Within an easy walk of my lodgings
in Brudenell Place I could pick may
off the country hedges.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Rydon had not commenced his building
operations, and the North Pole Gardens
were a rustic retreat for the citizens among
the fields. Highbury and Hornsey were
fairly out in the country; Islington was like
the provincial hamlet of to-day; Canonbury
was embowered in greenery.</p>

<p class='c017'>I could walk across fields all the way to
Dalston and Hackney; I played cricket in
the Cat and Mutton Fields; and there was
still something of an old-world romance in
the Shepherdess Walk!</p>

<p class='c017'>Yes! it was quite true Samuel Phelps was
playing Shakespeare at Sadler’s Wells in
those days, and gathering round him the
intelligent playgoers of his time; and I have
often handled a racket at the dear old open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>court at the “Belvedere” on Pentonville
Hill, which was one of the last of the roadside
ale-houses with green benches and trim
gardens facing the road, inns that were
dotted about the coach road between the
“Angel” at Islington and the “Yorkshire
Stingo” in Marylebone.</p>

<p class='c017'>Why, we passed through a turnpike between
Hoxton and the City, and in those
days the River Lea and the New River
flowed through summer fields and hay meadows,
and skirted houses, as romantically
situated as any that can be found in the
Warwickshire of to-day.</p>

<p class='c017'>I often chat of old times with Mr. and
Mrs. Cheevers, and have a friendly pipe
with the old man in the almshouse garden;
and, though now they are spending the winter of
their content in a peaceful paradise, I trust they
have still a warm corner in their hearts for
many scenes in the London of fifty years ago.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>And as you may know also, it was my
blessing and great privilege to be of some
comfort to poor Nick in the dreadful London
prison.</p>

<p class='c017'>Never for a moment did I doubt his innocence,
for there is a ring in a good man’s
voice, a warmth in his hand-clasp, and honesty
in his eyes that are absolutely convincing to
those who have made a study of criminal life.</p>

<p class='c017'>But what can a prison chaplain do, after
all, towards establishing justice and right?
He can listen to the heartfelt confession, can
comfort the innocent or the penitent, but he
can do little more than pray that right in
the end will overmaster wrong, and that true
love, like truth, will ultimately prevail.</p>

<p class='c017'>Assuredly they did so in the case of Nick
and Nan, for they were my hands that joined
their hands at the altar, and it was I, who
put to them that solemn oath of mutual fidelity
which they have never broken to this hour.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Out of the darkness comes the light, out
of the cloud comes the sunshine, and it is
my experience, that those who suffer most,
and that those who “have patience and
endure” have some of their reward in this
world as well as in the next.</p>

<p class='c017'>Whatever the sorrows of my life have
been—and they have been many and bitter
ones—I have had the comfort to-day of seeing
gathered together the happiest family in
all the land.</p>

<p class='c017'>I never shall forget the scene this Christmas
Eve, in the cosy sitting-room of their
lovely cottage by the sea.</p>

<p class='c017'>Outside, the sparkling snow covered the
garden, and rested softly on the tree branches
and the evergreens.</p>

<p class='c017'>Inside, the Yule logs sparkled on the hearth,
the old oak parlour was decorated with holly
and laurel and arbutus and mistletoe. The
table was laden with the good things of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>world, as it should be at Christmas time.
The wine that, honestly and temperately enjoyed,
is as much man’s possession as the
corn in the fields or the fruit on the garden
trees, sparkled in every glass. Each face
seemed radiant with joy.</p>

<p class='c017'>There sat old Barkston with his chaplain,
as I call myself, at his right hand, and his
youngest girl grandchild on his knee, an
auburn-haired darling of some six summers,
who delights the old gentleman by her
shrewd observations and her curious ways.</p>

<p class='c017'>There sat young Barkston, the Nick of
old days, with a girl child on his knee,
“dangling the grapes,” but with the disengaged
hand clasped in that of beautiful and
radiant Nan, who, like most fond mothers,
had the best place in her honest heart for
her only boy—young Nick, as he is familiarly
called.</p>

<p class='c017'>A little lower down, a little shy perhaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>but alternately garrulous and tearful, sat Mr.
and Mrs. Cheevers, who were placed at the
hospitable table as amongst the most favoured
guests.</p>

<p class='c017'>But before the party broke up and the
evening ended, there came that old Christmas
ceremony that, I regret to say, is falling
into disuse and neglect.</p>

<p class='c017'>At the command of our excellent host the
tables were cleared away, and the butler
brought in a splendid old china bowl of
steaming punch, decorated with holly and
flowers, and then all the servants trooped
into the room and were made welcome as
part of a united family. On this day of the
year they were no mere masters and mistresses
and servants and dependants, but
friends heart and soul.</p>

<p class='c017'>But before the punch was handed round,
there was to be an old-fashioned country
dance. Old Barkston, to her great delight,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>led out Mrs. Cheevers, who was great at her
steps as her grandmother, so she said, had
been before her.</p>

<p class='c017'>The hand of Nan was claimed both by
old Cheevers and the venerable butler, but
she decided that age should decide the
matter, promising an extra turn to the rejected
old gentleman.</p>

<p class='c017'>Nick had to dance with all the girls in
the household, who enjoyed the joke keenly,
particularly when he set the example of kissing
his partners under the mistletoe—an
example that the young men were very slow
and shy to follow.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>
<img src='images/i261.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“And pray that the parting may not be eternal.” (<i>Page <a href='#Page_264'>264</a></i>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And then, when the dancing and romping
were over, came the punch bowl, with glasses
all round and healths and tears and good
wishes. Then it was that old Cheevers delivered
himself, in reply to the universal toast,
“God bless us all,” of the words that still
ring in my ears, now that the doors of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>happy home are closed behind me, and I
walk dreaming of the past towards my solitary
home.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, this ’ere is wery wonderful, wery
wonderful, my dear! Just to think of our
little Nick and Nan, and me and you a
standing ’ere and drinking of their ’earty
good ’ealth, and the ’ealth of them dear little
ones, and a wishing of ’em a Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Good, honest souls, they had been present
at the two most eventful moments of the lives
of Nick and Nan.</p>

<p class='c017'>And for me, on this never-to-be-forgotten
Christmas Eve, there will be but one ceremony
more, a faithful and pious pilgrimage,
that I have never forgotten since the dead
and the living were united on that wind-swept
hill within sound of the sea.</p>

<p class='c017'>When all the lights are out, and the embers
are dying down on the hearth, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>silence reigns about this land of love, and
the peace is profound, I shall go in at the
gates of the Garden of Sleep, and I shall
kneel down on a grave, that is my dearest
possession, and I shall kiss the marble cross
above it, and pray that the parting may not
be eternal, and that we may meet again to
part no more for ever!</p>

<p class='c017'>And then, perhaps, before the prayer is
ended, and another day is born, the Christmas
joy bells will answer one another across
the frosty hills, and love and charity will be
in all the air, and the words will come home
to me, which will be the text of my Christmas
sermon:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will towards men.”</p>
<div class='c022'><span class='sc'>A Lonely Clergyman.</span></div>
